                      Our feedback form can be used for pretty much anything: questions, ideas, clarifications, etc.
                      It also gives you the option to leave feedback anonymously (but we won't be able to respond). Although,
                      we only check the form a few times a week, so it might be a few days before we get back to you.

              Over the past year, we've had tons of unsolicited assistance from community users. While we're extremely grateful
              for everyones hard work, this method often results in duplicate effots. Thus, we've created a list of ongoing and on-time
              needs that have been languishing in our backlog. If you'd like to contribute, please consult
              the list below and #[a(mailto="info@n7.world").blue--text.text--lighten-3 contact us] with what you'd like to work on.

                      We've filled out quite a few monsters in the bestiary, but there are still a lot to complete. If
                      you'd like to create an original monster stat block or revise a current one,

                      Thessiand Shadow, Szirach, and TheNamelessOne have all created great fillable PDFs (thanks!). But we've made a few changes
                      to our print version since then, so we're in need of some updates.

                    p.
                      Ben McPherson got pretty far with a Google Sheet version of the character sheet. If anyone is a guru
                      with GSheets and wants to take a stab at completing his work, it'd be a great help!

                    p.
                      With only 6 classes, it makes sense to adjust the character sheets with class specific information
                      and boxes. If you'd like to work on this, we can send you the original InDesign files so you can
                      work off the original character sheet.

                    p.
                      The spell cards are a year old and could use a designer's eye. The key challenge will be getting all
                      the spell text on the card.

                      The site uses Material Design Icons, icons from the Noun Project, and originally created icons.
                      We'd love for someone to create a new set of icons for us, one that reflects the Mass Effect universe.
                      Let us know if you're interested and we can provide a list icon needs.

                      We've been waiting on a more stable version of the ruleset to ask for this one. But as we slowly approach
