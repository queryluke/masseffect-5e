This effect lasts 1 min. You can only use Hunter Mode once per long rest.

At 11th level, you gain an additional benefit based on your class:

Class | Benefit

Engineer | Increase the damage of all spell by 1 die type (max d12). If the die type is already d12, add +1 damage for each die rolled instead.
Soldier | Your extra attack features grants you 1 additional attack the first time you take the Attack action on your turn.
Infiltrator | Increase your sneak attack die type to d8 (if you are a Ghost infiltrator, your sneak attack for melee weapons attacks is a d10).
