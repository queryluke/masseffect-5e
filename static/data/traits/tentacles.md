id: tentacles
name: Tentacles
---
You have six tentacles instead of arms that can grip tightly but can't lift anything heavier than a few kilograms, meaning
you can only wield weapons with the _light_ property. 

As an action, you can use one of your tentacles to try to grapple a creature. Each one is also a 
natural weapon, which you can use to make an unarmed strike. If you hit with it, the target takes bludgeoning 
damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. 
Immediately after hitting, you can try to grapple the target as a bonus action.

As an action, you can secrete a natural toxin from one of your tentacles. If a creature is grappled by the tentacle,
it must succeed a DC 11 Constitution saving throw of becomes <condition id="poisoned"/> for 1 hour. The DC of this
saving throw increases with your level: DC 13 at the 5th level, DC 15 at the 11th level, and DC 17 at the 17th level.
