Your suit is your lifeblood and consists of a reinforced, pressurized body suit and helmet. It makes your immune to 
disease and provides resistance to poison and necrotic damage. 

However, you are always at risk. If you are the victim of a critical hit that deals puncture or slashing damage, your 
suit becomes breached. As an action, you may spend 1 omni-gel to seal your suit. You have 3 omni-gel as part of their starting equipment.

If you are not in an environment made for volus, for each minute in which you have a breach in your suit, you suffer 
2d6 poison and 1d6 slashing damage. If you do not repair your suit or get to a volus-appropriate environment within 10 minutes, you die.
