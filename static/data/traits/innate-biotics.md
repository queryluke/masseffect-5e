Asari do not require biotic implants to control their abilities. Instead, their biotic talents rely on their ability
to project their will onto the world. As an Asari, you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a biotic spell you cast and
when making an attack roll with one.

Choose a class: Adept or Vanguard. You learn two cantrips of your choice from that classâ€™s spell list. In addition,
choose one 1st-level spell from that same list. You learn that spell and can cast it at its lowest level. Once you cast
it, you must finish a long rest before you can cast it again.

Neither of the cantrips nor the spell can be an advanced version. But you can learn or prepare an advanced version of
the spell as your class permits.
