id: contra-gravitic-levitation
name: Contra-gravitic Levitation
---
When not in water, you use a contra-gravitic levitation pack to move. It provides a walking speed of 10m, though
you actually hover between 1 and 2 meters from the ground. You are immune to becoming <condition id="prone"/> and you ignore any penalties
caused by difficult terrain.

However, when you suffer a critical hit, you must roll a d20. On a 1 or a 2, the device malfunctions and you fall to the
ground. Your walking speed becomes 0 and you are considered <condition id="prone"/>. You or another creature can use an 
Action to repair the pack with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Engineering) check.
