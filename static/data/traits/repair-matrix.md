Geth cannot gain health from medi-gel. Instead, they are equipped with a Repair Matrix.

If you begin your turn with less than half of your hit points and are not incapacitated, you may activate your repair matrix as a bonus action.
Gain 1d6 hit points now and at the start of each of your subsequent turns. This effect lasts 1 minute or until you
become incapacitated. This feature may only be used once per long rest.
