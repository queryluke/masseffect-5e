As a construct, you cannot be healed by medi-gel or spells that heal organic creatures (such as the _first aid_ spell).

Instead, you can use your Action to expend a Hit Die. Roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You regain 
hit points equal to the total. You also regain all spent hit dice at the end of a long rest, instead of the usual amount.

If you drop to 0 hit points, you must be stabilized with an Intelligence (Engineering) or Intelligence (Electronics) check, 
instead of a Wisdom (Medicine) check.

At the 4th level, you gain an additional number of hit dice equal to your character level divided by 4 (minimum 1). 
These bonus hit dice are d8s, regardless of your class.
