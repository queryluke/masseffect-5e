Your ranged weapons are shoulder mounted to your armor or in holsters and use a VI to aim and fire. When you make a
ranged weapon attack, use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier.

You can have one ranged weapon mounted on each shoulder. Mounting a ranged weapon requires you to be proficient with
the weapon type and takes at least 10 minutes of work during a short or long rest.
