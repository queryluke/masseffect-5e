Batarians are careful not to show weakness in front of their allies, for fear of losing status. If you miss with an
attack roll or fail an ability check or a saving throw, you can gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies
you can see within 10m of you (maximum bonus of +5). Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish
a short or long rest.
