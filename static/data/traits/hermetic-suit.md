name: Hermetic Suit
---
Your suit is your lifeblood and consists of a reinforced, skin-tight body suit and a helmet. It makes your immune to 
disease and provides resistance to poison and necrotic damage. 

However, you are always at risk. If you are the victim of a critical hit that deals puncture or slashing damage, your 
suit becomes breached. As an action, you may spend 1 omni-gel to seal your suit. You have 3 omni-gel as part of their starting equipment.

For each hour in which you have a breach in your suit, you suffer one level of exhaustion. For each hour you spend
outside of your suit if not in a compatible environment, suffer 3 levels of exhaustion.
