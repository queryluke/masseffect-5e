name: Blood Rage
---
When you kill an enemy, you can use a bonus action to enter a mindless blood rage. Blood rage lasts for 1 minute or 
until you end it as a bonus action. For the duration, you must move towards and attack an enemy on your turn and 
you cannot concentrate on spells. While in blood rage, are immune to being charmed or frightened and you gain 
temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier at the start of each of your turns. When blood rage ends, 
you lose any remaining temporary hit points from blood rage.

You must finish a long rest before you can enter blood rage again.
