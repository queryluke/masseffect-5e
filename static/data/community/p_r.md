name: "Additional Paragon / Renegade Rules"
---

If you want to add some additional mechanics to the <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/beyond-first-level#paragon-renegade">Paragon & Renegade</nuxt-link>
rules, consider the following. _These rules are in addition to the Paragon & Renegade rules_.

When your Paragon or Renegade score is higher than the other, choose 2 Charisma-linked skills. You always have advantage
when rolling those skills, but you have disadvantage when rolling the other 2 Charisma-linked skills. You can
adjust your selected skills whenever your paragon or renegade scores advance beyond the other.

__EXAMPLE__

Campbell's character, Negomi, has 55 Renegade and 20 Paragon points. He chooses Performance and Intimidation as Negomi's
__Renegade Skills__. Whenever Negomi makes a Performance or Intimidation check, she makes that check with Advantage.
But if Negomi makes a Persuasion or Deception check, those are made at disadvantage.

If, over the course of a few levels, Negomi gains 40 Paragon points and 0 Renegade points (60 and 55, respectively),
Campbell can choose 2 new skills (or the same ones) for Negomi to have advantage.

<br>

The benefit of this rule is that it rewards players for role-playing a Paragon or Renegade character. There are
4 Charisma-linked skills that can be role-played to either Paragon or Renegade. When the player selects their chosen 
Charisma benefits, they should roleplay to those strengths. If the player treats these benefits as purely mechanical, the 
GM can choose not to award the advantage.

Skill | Paragon-esque | Renegade-esque
--- | --- | ---
Performance | Classical | Rock-in-roll
Persuasion | Inspiring | Threatening
Intimidation | Threatens with laws | Threatens with pain
Deception | Augments the truth | Outright lies
