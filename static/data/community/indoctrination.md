name: "Indoctrination"

If your campaign is set during any part of the Reaper invasion, it's likely you'll need some 
<a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Indoctrination" target="_blank">indoctrination</a> effects.
While we encourage you to riff on these ideas or make up your own, here is a baseline for using indoctrination in your
campaign.

## Condition: Indoctrination
_Note: Synthetic beings are immune to indoctrination_

Spending time in the presence of Reaper technology can lead to a special condition called indoctrination. Indoctrination
is measured in six levels. For each 24 hour period a creature spends within the presence of a piece of Reaper tech,
they must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature suffers one level of indoctrination. 
If an already indoctrination character spends another 24 hour period within the presence of Reaper technology, the DC
of the saving throw increases as described below.

Determining if a creature is within the presence of a piece of Reaper technology is based on the technology's size. The
larger the object, the farther the range.

### Distance of Indoctrination
Size of tech | Range
--- | ---
Tiny | 10 meters
Small | 25 meters
Medium | 100 meters
Large | 1 kilometer (~ 1/2 a mile)
Huge | 10 kilometers (~ 6 miles)
Gargantuan |  100 kilometers (~ 60 miles)

### Levels of Indoctrination

Level | Next Wisdom DC | Effect
--- | --- | ---
1 | 12 | You have difficulty sleeping and constantly have dreams of inky black and oily shadows. To gain the benefits of a long rest takes an additional 4 hours.
2 | 14 | You begin showings signs of paranoia, having feelings of being watched. You have disadvantage on all your Charisma-based skill checks.
3 | 16 | You have extreme paranoia. You have disadvantage on all of your Wisdom- and Intelligence-based skill checks.
4 | 18 | You begin to hear voices that issue simple commands. If you do not immediately follow the command, you take 11 (2d10) psychic damage. This damage bypasses shields.
5 | 20 | The voices in your head speak to you often and you begin to agree with what they're saying. You are considered charmed.
6 | - | You become a Reaper thrall and lose all control of your character (You are effectively dead).

### Reducing Indoctrination
Every long rest that you spend outside of the range of Reaper technology, you can make a new Wisdom saving throw (DC based on your
current indoctrination level). On a success, reduce your indoctrination level by 1.
