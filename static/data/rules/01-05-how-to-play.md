title: How to Play

The play of the Dungeons & Dragons game (and by extension, Mass Effect 5e) unfolds according to this basic pattern.

### 1. The GM describes the environment.
The GM tells the players where their operatives are and what’s around them, presenting the basic scope of options that
present themselves (how many airlocks lead out of a space station, what’s on a table, who’s in the nightclub, and so on).

### 2. The players describe what they want to do.
Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying, “We’ll take the east door,” for example. Other times, different
operatives do different things: one operative might search a lock box while a second examines an esoteric symbol
spray painted on a wall and a third keeps a lookout for thugs. The players don’t need to take turns, but the DM listens
to every player and decides how to resolve those actions.

Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an operative wants to walk across a room and open a door, the GM might just say
that the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a tripwire, or some
other circumstance might make it challenging for an operative to complete a task. In those cases, the GM decides what
happens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action.

### 3. The DM narrates the results of the operatives’ actions.

Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back to step 1.

This pattern holds whether the operatives are cautiously exploring a derelict ship, talking to a devious politician, or
locked in a firefight against a squad of Batarian extremists. In certain situations, particularly combat, the action is
more structured and the players (and GM) do take turns choosing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is
fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the mission.

Often the action of a mission takes place in the imagination of the players and GM, relying on the GM’s verbal
descriptions to set the scene. Some GMs like to use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood, and many
players and GMs alike adopt different voices for the various operatives, aliens, and other characters they play in the
game. Sometimes, a GM might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures to represent each creature involved in a
scene to help the players keep track of where everyone is.

### Game Dice
The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in many
bookstores.

In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12,
and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the typical cube that many games use).

Percentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different
ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9. One die (designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and the other gives the
ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100. Some ten-sided dice are
numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit.
In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, and 00 and 0 is 100.

When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to add.
For example, “3d8 + 5” means you roll three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.

The same d notation appears in the expressions “1d3” and “1d2.” To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and divide the
number rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of 1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending on
whether it was odd or even. (Alternatively, if the number rolled is more than half the number of sides on the die, it’s a 2.)

### The D20

Does an operative’s Scimitar shotgun blast hurt a Reaper Brute or just bounce off its iron-hard skin? Will the asari
believe an outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging river? Can a character avoid the blast of a fragmentation
grenade, or does he or she take full damage from the explosion? In cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain,
the game relies on rolls of a 20-sided die, a d20, to determine success or failure.

Every character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six ability scores. The abilities are Strength, Dexterity,
Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for most operatives. (Monsters
might have scores as low as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the ability modifiers derived from them, are
the basis for almost every d20 roll that a player makes on a character’s or monster’s behalf.

Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the rules of
the game. All three follow these simple steps.

#### 1. Roll the die and add a modifier.
Roll a d20 and add the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and
it sometimes includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character’s particular skill. (See
<nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/character-creation">Step-By-Step Characters</nuxt-link> for details on each ability and how to determine an
ability’s modifier.)

#### 2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.
A class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.

#### 3. Compare the total to a target number.
If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise,
it’s a failure. The GM is usually the one who determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks,
attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.

The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a __Difficulty Class (DC)__. The target number for an
attack roll is called an __Armor Class (AC)__.

This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks in D&D play. <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/using-ability-scores">Using Ability Scores</nuxt-link>
provides more detailed rules for using the d20 in the game.

### Advantage and Disadvantage
Sometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is modified by special situations called advantage and disadvantage.
Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the opposite. When you
have either advantage or disadvantage, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if
you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17
and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.

More detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage are presented in the
<nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/using-ability-scores#advantage-and-disadvantage">Using Ability Scores</nuxt-link> section.

### Specific Beats General
This compendium contains rules that govern how the game plays. That said, many racial traits, class features, spells,
gadgets, monster abilities, and other game elements break the general rules in some way, creating an exception to how
the rest of the game works. Remember this: If a specific rule contradicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.

Exceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance, many operatives don’t have proficiency with shotguns, but every
soldier does because of a class trait. That trait creates a minor exception in the game. Other examples of rule-breaking
are more conspicuous. For instance, an operative can’t normally fly, but some spells and armor mods make that possible.
Biotics and tech account for most of the major exceptions to the rules.

### Round Down
There’s one more general rule you need to know at the outset. Whenever you divide a number in the game, round down if you
end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.
