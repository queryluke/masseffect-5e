title: 'Selling Items'

Opportunities abound to find tech, gadgets, equipment, weapons, armor, and more throughout the galaxy. Normally, you can
sell your bounty when you return to a civilized planet or spaceport, provided that you can find buyers, entrepreneurs, and
fencers interested in your loot.

### Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment
As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons
and armor used by mercenaries are rarely in good enough condition to sell. Instead, you may opt to break these items down
into <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/equipment#omni-gel">omni-gel</nuxt-link>.

### Gems, Jewelry, Art Objects, and Artifacts
These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for credits or use them as currency
for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the GM might require you to find a buyer in a large city or
larger community first.

### Trade Goods and Other
On the borderlands, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods - bars of
raw metal, chemicals, livestock, omni-gel, and so on - retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency.
