Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence,
and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.

### Charisma Checks

A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or
tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance,
and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.

  - Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip
  - Blend into a crowd to get a sense of key topics of conversation

### Spellcasting Ability
Asari and some other subraces use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving
throw DCs of spells they cast.
