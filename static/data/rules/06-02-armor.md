To survive in the galaxy, your character needs to wear armor. Not only does armor abate damage from extremely powerful,
futuristic weapons but armor also supplies __shield points__, also called shields (outlined below). Luckily, almost all
garments in the mass effect world provide some form of protection. Diaphanous night-gowns can even provide a modicum of
protection. Thus, in Mass Effect 5e, almost all operatives are wearing armor and re afforded shield points, unless the player
or GM explicitly states your character is not wearing armor.

__Armor Proficiency__. Just like 5th edition, anyone can put on armor. However, only those proficient in the armor type
know how to wear it effectively. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor (light, medium, or heavy).
If you are wearing 2 or more pieces of armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check,
saving throw, or Attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity. If you are wearing 4 pieces of armor you lack
proficiency with, you cannot cast Biotics or Tech and Combat powers.

__Armor Class (AC)__. Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor you wear determines your base Armor Class.

__Shield Points__. <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip> All armor chest pieces
provide some amount of shield points. See the <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/combat#shields">Shields</nuxt-link> of the combat section for
more information.



### Mix & Match <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip>
Unlike D&D 5th edition, armor in Mass Effect 5e can be mixed between armor placements on the body. There are 4 armor placements:
__Head__, __Chest__, __Arms__, and __Legs__.

Your base AC is 10 and each piece of armor provides an AC bonus depending on its type and placement as listed in
the Armor / AC table. Additionally, there are bonuses and limitations for the combination of armor types you are wearing,
explained in the Armor Bonuses and Limitations table.

For simplicity's sake, you cannot mix armor *within* placements. I.e., you cannot have a heavy piece of on your right arm
and a light piece of armor on your left.

#### Variant: Encumbrance
If you are using the <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/using-ability-scores#strength">Variant: Encumbrance</nuxt-link> rules,
use the Armor Piece Weights table to determine the total weight of the armor you're wearing.

### Armor Sets <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip>
Most armor you buy in the galaxy has been mass-produced, these are called __armor sets__. A set is not required to be
multiple pieces of armor. For example, the Capacitor Helmet is a single piece of head armor. The unique aspect of armor
sets is that they have benefits and attributes that are pre-installed due to their mass-production. Thus, you cannot
customize armor sets with armor mods and you cannot salvage a beneficial aspect from an armor set.

Armor sets have an armor type (light, medium, or heavy) which you use for calculating your character's AC.

__Body Armor__ is a set that contains 3 pieces of armor: chest, legs, and arms. A character that is wearing the BT Suit
armor set cannot wear additional armor on their chest, legs, or arms. But they could wear a Capacitor Helmet (medium head armor).

__Full Set__ is a set that contains all 4 pieces of armor: head, chest, arms, and legs.



### Environmental Protection <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip>
All armor provides basic environmental protection from the vacuum of space or hazardous atmospheres. Armor supplies enough
air and heat to the wearer for 8 hours of activity or 16 hours if the operative remains motionless. Your GM may require
that your character wear a helmet to gain this benefit, or they may use the __bubble rule__ and claim that all armor suits
can cast an energy "bubble" around your characters head to keep air in and the environment out.



### Getting Into and Out of Armor
The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor's category.

__Don__. This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor's AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.

__Doff__. This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you have help, reduce this time by half.

Category | Don | Doff
--- | --- | ---
Light Armor | 1 minute | 1 minute
Medium Armor | 5 minutes | 1 minute
Heavy Armor | 10 minutes | 5 minutes
