title: Using these Rules
---

This manual uses the <a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules" target="_blank">Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition Basic Rules</a>
as its core rule set. If you have never played D&D 5e, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the basic rules
first. Most of those rules are replicated and referenced in the rules section of this Player's Manual.

Not repeated here are basic rules for Dungeon (Galaxy) Masters which have additional rules on running successful campaigns.

### Using the Site

The __Rules__ dropdown on the left contains the necessary information you need for creating characters, going on missions,
leveling up, casting spells, and acquiring all the different types of equipment and vehicles available to you. Sections
that contain significant changes are:
- <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/equipment">Equipment</nuxt-link>, which includes brand-new rules for armor, weapons, and mods
- <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/combat">Combat</nuxt-link>, which includes information on kinetic barriers (shields)
- <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/vehicles">Vehicles</nuxt-link>, which contains a "bolt-on" set of rules for traveling through the galaxy

The __Characters__ dropdown contains the list of options you have when creating your characters which has brand new:

-  <nuxt-link to="/phb/backgrounds">Backgrounds</nuxt-link>

__VARIANT RULES__

Occasionally, you'll see a rule preceded by the word "Variant". This means the rule is optional. In some cases,
it may replace an existing rule. For example, the Variant: Encumbrance rule replaces the standard Lifting & Carrying rules.

In other instances, the rule may be completely ignored. For example, the Paragon & Renegade system adds rules for utilizing
paragon and renegade points. While this adds a nice touch of flavor from the original _Mass Effect_ trilogy, it is not required
for this system to work, and it can safely be left out of your campaign if desired.
