>It was discovered that, in an age of kinetic barriers, most firefights were won by the side who could put the most
rounds downrange the fastest. As such, detachable heat sinks, known as thermal clips, were adopted first by the geth,
and shortly thereafter by organic arms manufacturers. Ammunition may never be a concern with modern arms, but the
availability of thermal clips is; weapons without thermal clips have nowhere to disperse their heat and are incapable of
firing. Luckily, thermal clips litter modern battlefields and can be obtained from fallen enemies or found around the
environment.

### Using Thermal Clips
When you reload your weapon, you expend a thermal clip.

### Armor Capacity: 10
All armor comes standard with 10 thermal clip slots. Some armor and mods allow you to increase this amount.

### Resupplying: ~100 credits
Thermal clips are easily looted from almost every enemy wielding a weapon. However, you can also resupply all of your
thermal clips at a gun shop or military depot for about 100 credits.

__Note__: Because thermal clips are so easily attainable, GMs might find it more manageable to simply not keep track of
thermal clips and assume players will always have a steady supply available to them.

### Variant: Venting
Instead of thermal clips, each weapon's heat indicates the number of times it can be fired before it overheats. Replace 
any reference to Reloading with Venting. Venting works exactly the same as reloading, taking some amount of time to vent 
the weapons heat (instead of reloading a thermal clip).

If a weapon is not fired for a full round of combat, it naturally regains 1 heat. Additionally, any weapon that is at 0 
heat can be fired, but it automatically jams and cannot be used until after a long rest.
