### Spell Types
Mass Effect divided spells into 3 distinct categories:

#### Biotics
Biotics is the ability of some lifeforms to create mass effect fields using element zero nodules embedded in body
tissues. These powers are accessed and augmented by using bio-amps. Biotic individuals can knock enemies over from a
distance, lift them into the air, generate gravitational vortices to tear obstacles or enemies apart, or create
protective barriers. Biotic spells are available for Adepts, Sentinels, and Vanguards.

#### Tech
Tech spells rely on the character's omni-tool: a multipurpose diagnostic and manufacturing tool as well as a computer used
for a variety of civilian and battlefield tasks, such as hacking, decryption, or repair. Higher-end omni-tools are
equipped by Engineers, Sentinels, and Infiltrators to make use of their tech talents and powers. When activated, an
omni-tool can appear over either of a person's forearms and/or hands, and occasionally both, as an orange hologram.

#### Combat Powers
Combat spells rely on gadgets, physical devices, special equipment or even overriding safety protocols on armor or weapons.
Combat powers have no casting cost, as they are generally instantiated by some sort of gadget or device. Instead of a
casting cost, combat powers recharge on a short or long rest.
