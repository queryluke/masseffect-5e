### Known Spells
Biotics rely on physical mnemonics and a biotic implant to harness the power of mass effect fields. Learning the mnemonics
takes years of practice. Once mastered, biotic users can learn new varieties of controlling the fields. As biotic characters
progress in levels, they learn knew varieties of biotic spells or can augment the power or utility of an existing one.
In any case, once a biotic user learns a spell, it is always at their disposal.

### Prepared Spells
Tech powers utilize technological assistance and micro-fabricators that are built into the operative's omni-tool.
Unlike biotic users, tech users can program new spells and powers into their omni-tool
like loading software onto a computer. However, the mental load required to access these powers in the heat of combat
takes a superior intellect. More programs cause more confusion, and without the mental training and years of practice,
tech users are limited in the number of spells they can bring into combat. This limit increases as tech users level, detailed
in the class's description.

### Advancing Spells <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip>
The class progression tables indicate when a class learns a new spell. In Mass Effect 5e, characters can choose
to augment a spell they've already learned rather than learning a new one. You may only have one advancement of a spell at a time.
