title: 'Transports vs Starships'
---

All vehicles are broadly categorized as either a transport or a starship. A __transport__ can be any of a wide range of
vehicles from a single-person ATV or motorbike to an armored personnel carrier to a small shuttle or orbital star-fighter.
__Starship__ refers to (typically larger) vessels designed to travel in deep space between planets. A general
rule-of-thumb is that if a vehicle can travel from one world to another, either by means of an FTL drive or a mass
effect relay, it is a Starship. Otherwise, it’s probably a transport.

A notable exception is the UT-47 Kodiak drop shuttle featured through the Mass Effect series. This vehicle, and others
like it, can be considered both a “transport” and a “starship”, depending on the context.
