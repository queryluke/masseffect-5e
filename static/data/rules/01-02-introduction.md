The Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game is about storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery and Mass Effect 5e
takes that storytelling to the stars. Both shares elements with childhood games of make-believe. Like those games,
D&D is driven by imagination. It’s about picturing the alien landscape beneath the two-sunned sky and imagining how an
N7 soldier might react to the challenges that scene presents.

__Galaxy Master (GM)__: You arrived on Asteroid 2179 JK178 on a UT-47 Kodiak. Approaching the station’s hangar, a missile
lock alarm sounds in the cockpit. Your pilot, Harcourt Finn, immediately took evasive action and put down on the opposite
side of the asteroid. Scans indicate the automated defensive system should extend around the entire asteroid but appears
to be dormant on the side opposite the station entrance. Having no other options, you double-checked the pressure seals
on your armor and set out on foot across the asteroid’s surface. After a quick 3 kilometer jaunt, you arrive at the edge
of the asteroid. Looking down, you can see the hangar doors sealed tight. You’ll have to find another way in …
\
__Amanda (playing Melphine)__: I want to scan the area for movement or any immediate threats.
\
__Amie (playing Telos)__: The drop to the hanger door looks pretty far? I want to test how much gravity the asteroid has.
Do I think we can easily drop down to it without injuring ourselves or flying off into space?

Unlike a game of make-believe, D&D gives structure to the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the operatives’
action. Players roll dice to resolve whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their operatives can scale a cliff,
roll away from the strike of a biotic blase, or pull off some other dangerous task. Anything is possible,
but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.

<simple-card><template slot="text">
__Galaxy Master (GM)__: OK, one at a time. Amanda, you’re looking for threats?
\
__Amanda__: Yeah. Is there any movement in the area?
\
__GM__: Make a Wisdom check.
\
__Amanda__: Does my Perception skill apply?
\
__GM__: Of course!
\
__Amanda (rolling a d20)__: Rats. Eight.
\
__GM__: No movement that you can see. And Amie, Telos is assessing the drop to the hanger bay?

In the Mass Effect 5e game, each player creates an operative (also called a character) and teams up with other
operatives (played by friends). Working together, the group might explore a derelict starship, the slums of an inhabited asteroid,
the glorious streets of an advanced civilization, an ancient temple deep in a jungle, or the steppes of a mining colony.
The operatives can solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle alien monsters, and discover advanced technologies
and relics from a past age.

One player, however, takes on the role of the Galaxy Master (GM), the game’s lead storyteller and referee. The GM creates
missions for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The GM might describe the
entrance to Osiris Station, and the players decide what they want their operatives to do. Will they jump down to the hanger bay?
Propel themselves with jetpacks? Or use a biotic's powers to increase their mass, "affixing" themselves to the surface of 
the asteroid? Then the GM determines the results of the operatives’ actions and narrates what they experience. Because the GM
can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, D&D (and Mass Effect 5e) is infinitely flexible, and each
mission can be exciting and unexpected.

The game has no real end; when one story or quest wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing story called a
__campaign__. Many people who play the game keep their campaigns going for months or years, meeting with their friends
every week or so to pick up the story where they left off. The operatives grow in might as the campaign continues. Each
monster defeated, each mission completed, and each gadget recovered not only adds to the continuing story but also
earns the operatives new capabilities. This increase in power is reflected by an operative’s level.

There’s no winning and losing in the Dungeons & Dragons game—at least, not the way those terms are usually understood.
Together, the GM and the players create an exciting story of bold operatives who confront deadly perils. Sometimes an
operative might come to a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious rachni or done in by a nefarious Cerberus assassin. Even so,
the other operatives can search for breaking-edge medical experiments to revive (or clone!) their fallen comrade, or the
player might choose to create a new character to carry on. The group might fail to complete a mission successfully,
but if everyone had a good time and created a memorable story, they all win.
