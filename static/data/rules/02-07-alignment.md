title: '4.b Alignment'
---

A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment
is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes
toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.

These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment.
Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently
faithful to the precepts of their alignment.

__Lawful good (LG)__ creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Asari justicars, quarians,
and some turians are lawful good.

__Neutral good (NG)__ beings do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many salarians and most
protheans are neutral good.

__Chaotic good (CG)__ creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect.
Some angara, asari, and a number of humans are chaotic good.

__Lawful neutral (LN)__ individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Some geth, volus, and
most drell are lawful neutral.

__Neutral (N)__ is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and donâ€™t take sides, doing what
seems best at the time. Volus, some batarians, and many humans are neutral.

__Chaotic neutral (CN)__ creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else.
Maiden asari, some vorcha, and humans are chaotic neutral.

__Lawful evil (LE)__ creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or
order. Most Krogan, volus, and batarians are lawful evil.

__Neutral evil (NE)__ is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms.
Heretic geth, Reapers, and vorcha are neutral evil.

__Chaotic evil (CE)__ creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust.
Some Krogan, batarians, and some Vorcha are chaotic evil.

<strong>BUILDING KALEEM, STEP 4.B</strong><br>
Sam picks a lawful alignment for Kaleem, as she buys into the tradition of the Blue Suns and respects their codes. Kaleem's
lack of empathy makes her neutral in her disposition for moral codes.
