The game consists of a group of characters embarking on a mission that the Galaxy Master presents to them. Each
character brings particular capabilities to the mission in the form of ability scores and skills, class features,
racial traits, equipment, and gadgets. Every character is different, with various strengths and weaknesses, so the best
party of operatives is one in which the characters complement each other and cover the weaknesses of their companions.
The operatives must cooperate to successfully complete the mission.

The mission is the heart of the game, a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. a mission features a fantastic
setting, whether it’s the ruins of an ancient civilization, an asteroid, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city. It
features a rich cast of characters: the operatives created and played by the other players at the table, as well as
nonplayer characters (NPCs). Those characters might be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or just background extras
in a mission. Often, one of the NPCs is a villain whose agenda drives much of a mission’s action.

Over the course of their missions, the characters are confronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and situations
that they must deal with in some way. Sometimes the operatives and other creatures do their best to kill or capture
each other in combat. At other times, the operatives talk to another creature (or even an AI) with a goal in mind. And
often, the operatives spend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass an obstacle, find something hidden, or unravel the
current situation. Meanwhile, the operatives explore the galaxy, making decisions about which way to travel and what
they’ll try to do next.

missions vary in length and complexity. A short mission might present only a few challenges, and it might take no
more than a single game session to complete. A long mission can involve hundreds of combats, interactions, and other
challenges, and take dozens of sessions to play through, stretching over weeks or months of real time. Usually, the end
of a mission is marked by the operatives heading back to some form of 'home base' to rest and enjoy the spoils of
their labors.

But that’s not the end of the story. You can think of a mission as a single episode of a TV series, made up of
multiple exciting scenes. A campaign is the whole series—a string of missions joined together, with a consistent group
of operatives following the narrative from start to finish.

### The Three Pillars of mission

__Exploration__ includes both the operatives’ movement through the world and their interaction with objects and situations
that require their attention. Exploration is the give-and-take of the players describing what they want their characters
to do, and the Galaxy Master telling the players what happens as a result. On a large scale, that might involve the
characters spending a day crossing an icy plain or an hour making their way through tunnels of city's transit tube. On
the smallest scale, it could mean one character pushing a button on the console to see what happens.

__Social interaction__ features the operatives talking to someone (or something) else. It might mean demanding that a
captured soldier reveal the passcode to the enemies stronghold, getting information from a rescued prisoner, pleading for
mercy from a krogan chieftain, or persuading a talkative unshackled AI to unlock a navigation route to a distant planet.

The rules in <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/using-ability-scores">Using Ability Scores</nuxt-link> and
<nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/missions">Missions</nuxt-link> support exploration
and social interaction.

__Combat__, the focus of the <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/combat">Combat</nuxt-link> section, involves characters and other creatures
shooting weapons, casting biotics and tech, maneuvering for position, and so on—all in an effort to defeat their opponents,
whether that means killing every enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout. Combat is the most structured element of a
game session, with creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets a chance to act. Even in the context of a
pitched battle, there’s still plenty of opportunity for operatives to attempt wacky stunts like surfing one a drone,
to examine the environment (perhaps by pushing a very large red button), and to interact with other creatures,
including allies, enemies, and neutral parties.
