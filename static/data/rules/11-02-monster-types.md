title: 'Monster Types'

There aren't enough spells and powers to justify making bonuses like "double damage to beast". In addition, many of
the 5th Edition monster types don't make sense in the sci-fi setting (celestials, undead, fey, elemental, etc.). Instead,
there are only three monster types: __Organic__, __Synthetic__, and __Synthorganic__.
