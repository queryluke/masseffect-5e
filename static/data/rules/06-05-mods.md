Armor and Weapon mods allow you to upgrade your equipment, providing powerful bonuses. Weapon and armor mods have their
own costs. Operatives who are proficient with Tinker's tools can craft mods but most can be purchased from your local equipment
shop. Once you've acquired your mod, you can install it yourself (if you're proficient with Armorsmith's, Tailor's, or
Weaponsmith's tools) or you can have an equipment shop install it for you.

### Removing Mods
In general, mods cannot be removed. Those proficient with Armorsmith's, Tailor's, or Weaponsmith's tools may attempt to
salvage mods at the risk of destroying the weapon or armor and all other installed mods. Equipment shops around the galaxy
typically won't offer this service for fear of a lawsuit.

### Weapon Mods
- __Ranged weapon mod slots__. Magazine, Body, Ammo, and Barrel.
- __Melee weapon mod slots__. Grip, and Strike.

Weapons are only allowed one mod per slot.  For example, the M-8 Avenger cannot have the Ultralight Materials and the 
Precision Scope, because both of those mods utilize the Body slot. Some mods are limited by weapon type. For example, 
the Stunner mod is only available for placement on Heavy Pistols and SMGs. Finally, you cannot add weapon mods to any 
weapon with the _special_ property.

### Armor Mods
Installing armor mods requires you to craft or purchase a piece of customizable armor. See
the Creating Armor section above. Each piece of customizable armor
has a set number of mod slots. You must select a mod with a matching armor piece, i.e. chest, head, legs, or arms.
