Longtime Mass Effect players will certainly want to reference Shepard's ability to secure discounts from local shops. One option
is to have players make Intimidation or Persuasion checks (with or without Paragon/Renegade scores). However, for
added variety and randomness, you can use the following set of rules.

First, assign a DC to your shopkeeper. The DC could be equal for Intimidation and Persuasion, or it could be different for each.

Next, have you player make an Intimidation or Persuasion check. If using Paragon/Renegade rule, they can add their Renegade modifier to
Intimidation checks or Paragon modifier for Persuasion checks. The result of this check adds a modifier to the final d100 roll (see next step).

- __Critical Failure__: -50
- __Failure__: -20
- __Success__: +20
- __Critical Success__: +50

Finally, the GM or player rolls a d100 adding the modifier from the previous step. Consult the following table for the resolution.

1d100 | Result
--- | ---
<= 10 | The shopkeeper is furious that you would attempt to cheat them out of their wares. They will not do business with you or your party.
11-30 | The shopkeeper sees through your ruse. If you're going to play it that way, you'll have to pay 10% more.
31-50 | The shopkeeper is unmoved. They aren't going to give you a discount, but they're not shutting their doors either.
51-70 | The shopkeeper has seen these ploys before, but you gave him a good chuckle, for that, you get a 10% discount.
71-90 | Better to work with you than against you, the shopkeeper offers you a 20% discount.
>= 91 | Either completely enthralled with your proposal, or scared out of their wits, the shopkeeper offers you a one-item discount of 50% off, and a lifetime discount of 20% off.
