title: '4. Describe Your Character'
---

Once you know the basic game aspects of your character, it’s time to flesh him or her out as a person. Your character’s
name, physical description, and personality might be the first things that the other players at the table learn about you.
It’s worth thinking about how these characteristics reflect the character you have in mind.

### Your Character's Abilities
Take your character’s ability scores and race into account as you flesh out his or her appearance and personality. A very
strong character with low Intelligence might think and behave very differently from a very smart character with low Strength.

For example, high Strength usually corresponds with a burly or athletic body, while a character with low Strength might
be scrawny or plump.

A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and slim, while a character with low Dexterity might be either gangly
and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.

A character with high Constitution usually looks healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A character with low
Constitution might be sickly or frail.

A character with high Intelligence might be highly inquisitive and studious, while a character with low Intelligence
might speak simply or easily forget details.

A character with high Wisdom has good judgment, empathy, and a general awareness of what’s going on. A character with
low Wisdom might be absent-minded, foolhardy, or oblivious.

A character with high Charisma exudes confidence, which is usually mixed with a graceful or intimidating presence. A
character with a low Charisma might come across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid.

<strong>BUILDING KALEEM, STEP 4</strong><br>
Sam lets her ability scores influence the type of character Kaleem is: her high Intelligence suggests a rapid, focused
mind, higher Strength and Constitution suggest a healthy, athletic body, and her low Charisma suggests stand-offish or
awkward social decorum.
