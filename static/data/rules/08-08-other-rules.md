### Variant: Navigation

As a GM, you can choose whether or not exploration & navigation are an essential component. If not, you can assume that
every ship has a full list of star maps and travel from cluster to cluster and system to system is as easy as punching
in coordinates.

However, if you'd like to provide more of a challenge, you can have your players use the Navigation starship system to
navigate the galaxy. With this rule, have your players make an Intelligence (Science) check before any planned travel,
representing the plotting of a course. The DC of this roll is either 12 (for known locations) or 18 (for unknown).
On a success, the characters arrive at the location as normal, but it takes twice as much time and fuel on a failure.
You can also impose other consequences such as pirates, disgruntled crew, or ship damage.

Whether or not the characters know of a location is dependent on __Star Maps__. You may choose to break up star maps
by Sectors (the large groupings of clusters) or by clusters.

### Variant: Mining & Probes
Ships can be equipped with Mining Probes. Each probe costs 100 credits and ships have a capacity based on its size:
10 for frigates, 20 for carriers, 50 for cruisers, and 100 for dreadnoughts. When orbiting a celestial body,
an operative can use the ship's SSC system to expend a Mining Probe and make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The
DC of this check is determined by how "rich" the planet is.

On a success, you can spend a long rest mining the area. Roll a die based on how rich the planet is, and gain that many
units of the element.

### Variant: Fuel
Fuel in Mass Effect 5e is an abstract concept. Most ships can mine and create fuel using on-board fabricators as it travels
the Galaxy. Fuel is represented by the __range__ of the ship (how far it can travel in 24 hours). If you would like to keep track
of fuel, the GM can use the following Variant: Fuel rules.

You "tank" capacity is equal to your ship's range multiplied by 3. Each time you expend 1 range, you also expend 1 charge from your
tank. You can either spend a long rest on an asteroid or planet mining fuel or you can refuel at a spaceport. To mine
fuel use the Variant: Mining rules above. On a success, roll a d8 and regain that many charges.

Alternatively, you can pay to refuel at a spaceport. The average rate is 1,000 credits per charge in your tank, but this
might increase or decrease based on the port.
