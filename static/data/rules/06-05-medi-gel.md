>Medi-gel (medical gel) is an all-purpose medicinal salve combining an anaesthetic and clotting agent used by paramedics,
EMTs, and military personnel, produced by the Sirta Foundation. It heals various wounds and ailments, instantly sealing
injuries against infection and allowing for rapid healing by having the gel grip tight to flesh until subjected to a frequency
of ultrasound. It is sealable against liquids - most notably blood - as well as contaminants and gases.

### Using Medi-gel
As an action, use a medi-gel pack on yourself or a willing creature within 2m. The target regains hit points equal to the
medi-gel's potency as listed in the Medi-gel Types table.

### Armor Capacity: 4
All armor comes standard with a capacity for 4 medi-gel. Some armor and mods allow you to increase this amount.

#### Resupplying: ~100 credits
As long as you're in a relatively civilized environment, you can easily resupply your medi-gel at a medical facility.
However, you would need insider or black-market connections to get Superior or Ultimate medi-gel. Since Ultimate medi-gel
is so rare, the cost is entirely dependent on the people you know, favors your owed, or ability to break into a medical facility.
