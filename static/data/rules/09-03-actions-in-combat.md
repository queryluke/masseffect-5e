When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your
class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.

When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and
what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.



### Attack
The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing a gun, or brawling
with your fists.

With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the "Making an Attack" section for the rules that govern attacks.

Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the soldier, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.



### Cast a Spell
Spellcasters such as engineers and adepts have access to biotics or tech powers and can use them to great effect in combat.
Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours
to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action,
so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.



### Dash
When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after
applying any modifiers. With a speed of 10 meters, for example, you can move up to 20 meters on your turn if you dash.

Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 10 meters
is reduced to 6 meters, for instance, you can move up to 12 meters this turn if you dash.



### Disengage <v-chip color="orange accent-2" text-color="black" class="v-chip--x-small">change</v-chip>
If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn. In  Mass Effect 5e,
the Disengage action can also kick off your shield regeneration, detailed later.



### Dodge <v-chip color="orange accent-2" text-color="black" class="v-chip--x-small">change</v-chip></h4>
When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack
roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage.
You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated or if your speed drops to 0.

The Dodge action can also jumpstart shield regeneration.



### Help
You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you
aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes
the check before the start of your next turn.

Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 2 meters of you. You feint, distract the
target, or in some other way team up to make your ally's attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before
your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.



### Hide <v-chip color="orange accent-2" text-color="black" class="v-chip--x-small">change</v-chip></h4>
When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for
<nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/using-ability-scores#dexterity">hiding</nuxt-link>.

If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the "Unseen Attackers and Targets" section later.

Hiding is the third possible way to jumpstart your shield regeneration.



### Ready
Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take
the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.

First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in
response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include "If the Blue Suns grunt steps
on the conveyor belt, I'll push the button that starts it," and "If the rachni steps next to me, I move away."

When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember
that you can take only one reaction per round.

When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger
occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell's magic requires
concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are
concentrating on the singularity spell and ready lance, your singularity spell end, and if you take damage before you
release lance with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.



### Reload <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip>
All guns have a heat property which indicates the number of times it can be fired before the thermal clip must be exchanged.
When you take the Reload Action, you expend a Thermal Clip from your inventory and insert it into the weapon you're currently
holding, returning the weapon's heat to its maximum value.

#### Variant: Rapid Reload
At the start of your turn, if you are holding only a single weapon, you may use a Bonus Action to attempt a Rapid Reload.
Make a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. On a success, you reload the weapon you're currently holding and may continue your turn as normal.
On a failure, you must take the Reload action this turn. On a critical failure, the thermal clip drops from your hand,
your weapon is not reloaded, and you lose your Action.

*Why is this a variant rule?* Although there are class features and weapon mods that allow you to reload as a bonus action,
this variant rule gives all classes a potential chance to reload as a bonus action. In turn, this increases the number of
potential rolls per combat, which can be cumbersome and distracting. It's up to the GM and players to decide if this rule
is right for their group.



### Search
When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search,
the GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.



### Use an Object
You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw your weapon as part of an attack.
When an object requires your action for its use (such as throwing a grenade), you take the Use an Object action.
This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.
