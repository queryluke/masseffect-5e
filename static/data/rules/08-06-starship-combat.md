Vehicle combat works similarly to standard creature combat. Each player rolls initiative as normal. Each enemy vehicle
also rolls initiative, with any NPCs on board those vehicles acting on the vehicles initiative count. Vehicles do not
add any bonus to their initiative rolls. You may use the vehicles’ speed to break ties between vehicle rolls.

The primary difference in starship combat is that operatives on board a starship have an additional list of actions
they can make on their turn. Most actions require the player to be stationed at the necessary __system__. When an
encounter begins, operatives may choose to “Report to battle stations” and place themselves at a specific system.

### Starship Actions

#### Attack - Weapon System
Make a ranged attack roll. Do not add your proficiency bonus unless you are proficient with Starship Systems (Weapons).

#### Targeted Attack - Weapon System
Name a system on a target vehicle and make a ranged attack roll. The target’s AC has a +5 bonus against this attack. On
a hit, roll damage and the system is __disabled__ and cannot be used until it is __repaired__. Any creature manning that
system takes damage equal to one half the damage roll.

#### Maneuver - Helm
Make a DC 15 Dexterity (Vehicle Handling) check.  On a success, your ship’s AC increases by an amount equal to half
its speed score until the start of your next turn.

#### Hard Maneuver - Helm
Make a DC 20 Dexterity (Vehicle Handling) check. On a success, your ship’s AC increases by an amount equal to twice its
speed score until the start of your next turn. Creatures on board your ship must make a Constitution saving throw to
endure to heavy g-forces imposed on the ship. On a failed save, a creature has disadvantage on its next action. Creatures
on board your ship cannot take the Move action until the start of your next turn.

#### Repair - Anywhere
Make a DC 15 Intelligence (Engineering) check. On a success, you patch some damage done to your ship, restoring
50 hit points.

#### Advanced Repair - Anywhere
Make a DC 20 Intelligence (Engineering) check. On a success, you manage to repair major damage, restoring 150 hit points.

#### System Repair - Disabled System
To take this action, you must be located at a system that is __disabled__. Make a DC 20 Intelligence (Engineering) check.
On a success, the system is repaired and can be used again.

#### Restore - Drive
Make a DC 15 Intelligence (Engineering) check. On a success, you’re able to reroute power to your shields, restoring 100
shield points.

#### Harden - EWS
Make a DC 10 Intelligence (Electronics) check. On a success, you harden the security of your EWS until the start of
your next turn. While hardened, any attempt to sabotage your ship will have disadvantage.

#### Sabotage - EWS
Choose a target from the table below and make an Intelligence (Electronics) check. The DC of this check and its effect
on a success is determined by the chosen target. You must choose your target before making your Intelligence check.

#### Scan - SSC
Make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check as your peruse the logs of incoming ship data. On a success, you may
ask one question about a target ship. The GM must answer this question honestly.

#### Flee - Navigation
Make a DC 14 Intelligence (Science) check to plot a course away from battle. On a success, you may enter FTL and flee
the battle. Combat immediately ends and you move to a system within your ship’s range.

#### Move - Anywhere
Use your Action to move to a different Starship System.

#### Help - Anywhere
Use your Action to Help a friendly creature use a Starship System. You must be located at the same system as the
creature. The creature gains advantage the next time it takes an action with the starship system.

#### Defer to VI - Anywhere
Use your Action to defer to the ship’s onboard VI. You may have it take any of the Starship System actions. When you do
so, roll a d20 to make the check or attack. You cannot add any modifiers or bonuses to the roll.
