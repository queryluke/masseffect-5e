Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm.
A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.

There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of
cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and
a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.

### Half Cover
A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks
at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature,
whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.

### Three-quarters Cover
A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover
if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a doorway, a large crate, or a thick tree trunk.

### Total Cover
A target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a
target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.

#### Size
Size matters. If the target is one size larger than the creature providing cover, the target has no cover. If the target
is one size smaller than the creature providing cover, the target has three-quarters cover.

#### High Ground
Flying enemies or creatures on high ground are able to shoot over cover depending on the type of cover provided

#### Friendly Fire
Don't hit your friends! If the creature providing cover is friendly and the attacking creature misses, the attack has a
50% chance to hit the friendly target. Roll a die and if the result is odd the attack hits, even the attack misses both
creatures. Or you can use the friendly creature's AC to decide if the attack hits or misses.
