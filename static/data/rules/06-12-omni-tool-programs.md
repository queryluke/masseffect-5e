Omni-tools are handheld devices that combine a computer microframe, sensor analysis pack, and minifacturing fabricator.
The fabrication module can rapidly assemble small three-dimensional objects from common, reusable industrial plastics,
ceramics, and light alloys. This allows for field repairs and modifications to most standard items, as well as the
reuse of salvaged equipment.

Most omni-tools come with a standard set of functionality, including scanning, remote interfacing, and some fabricator
designs.  However, there exist in the galaxy a number of advanced omni-tool programs that are not available for the general
population's consumption. These programs tend to be of military design, experimental hacks or deprecated programs
that have been scrubbed from the exonet.

### Installation

Some omni-tool programs require an operative to integrate the module into the tool's microframe before the benefits can
be used. This process is called Installation, and certain programs have a prerequisite for it.

Installation requires an operative to spend a short rest focused on only installing and debugging the program. If the short
rest is interrupted, the installation attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the operative gains the
benefits of the program.

A program can be installed to only one omni-tool at a time. Almost all programs come with a powerful DRM and security
system that prevents the program being installed on multiple omni-tools or replicated. Interestingly,
before the humans were granted an embassy on the Citadel in 2165, the concept of digital rights management was foreign to
the other races of the galaxy. But since 2165, omni-tool programs have been locked down. Attempting to hack the DRM
generally has a terrible result.

An omni-tool can only have three programs activated at once. Any attempt to install to a fourth program fails; the operative
must first uninstall the program from their tool (this also takes a short rest). Once uninstalled, the program can be
traded and installed on a separated tool. Additionally, omni-tools can't have more than one copy of a program installed.


### Single-Use Programs

Manufacturers and militaries quickly realized it was much easier, cheaper, faster, and (usually) safer to send bits of
data rather than physical products, and let fabricators generate the devices on site using generic materials, like omni-gel.
After the advent of omni-tools, a number of industries used this method to ship their products. However, to avoid
unauthorized replication, the programs would scrub themselves once the job was complete.

Omni-tool programs that don't require installation are single-use and cost a number of omni-gel to create the final product.
Once used, the program is completely wiped. As with installed programs, attempts to recreate these pieces of code can be
costly, even deadly.

### Unstable Programs

Unstable Programs are entirely experimental, therefore the number of times you can run the program varies widely. In some
cases, unstable programs are single-use programs that are hacked for multiple uses. A GM can create an Unstable Program
from a Single-Use program by assigning a die roll (d4, d6, etc) to the number of times the program can be used.
