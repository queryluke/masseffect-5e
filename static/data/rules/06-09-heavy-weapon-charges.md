Heavy weapons require __charges__ to be used. A charge is a generic term that can refer to a missile, energy source, or
raw material.

### Resupplying: ~5,000 credits
If you've got your hands on a heavy weapon, you're either a military specialist or damn lucky you survived the battle.
It's not easy resupplying your charges. You'll need to have some serious military or black market connections. If military,
you might get special permission to keep the weapon and granted a steady stream of charges (once per long rest). That's
between you and your Galaxy Master.

Otherwise, you'll have to pay a pretty penny on the black-market to recharge your Heavy Weapon (5,000-7,000 credits for
a complete resupply of charges). In most cases, it's easier to scavenge or steal ammo. Or simply leave the damn thing
where you found it.
