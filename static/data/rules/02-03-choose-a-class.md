title: '2. Choose a Class'

Every operative is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a character’s vocation, what special talents he or she
possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely to employ when exploring a planet, fighting alien monsters, or engaging
in a tense negotiation. The character classes are described in the [Classes](/phb/classes) section.

Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class. Many of these benefits are class features — capabilities
(including spellcasting) that set your character apart from members of other classes. You also gain a number of
proficiencies: armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your proficiencies define many of the things
your character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a convincing lie.

On your character sheet, record all the features that your class gives you at 1st level

### Level
Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in level by adventuring and gaining experience points (XP). A
1st-level character is inexperienced in the adventuring world, although he or she might have been a soldier or a space pirate
and done dangerous things before.

Starting off at 1st level marks your character’s entry into the adventuring life. If you’re already familiar with the
game, or if you are joining an existing ME5e campaign, your GM might decide to have you begin at a higher level, on the
assumption that your character has already survived a few harrowing missions.

Record your level on your character sheet. If you’re starting at a higher level, record the additional elements your
class gives you for your levels past 1st. Also, record your experience points. A 1st-level character has 0 XP. A higher-level
character typically begins with the minimum amount of XP required to reach that level (see “Beyond 1st Level” later in this section).

### Hit Points and Hit Die
Your character’s hit points define how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your hit points
are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit Point Dice).

At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die type is determined by your class. You start with hit points equal
to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your class description. (You also add your Constitution modifier, which
you’ll determine in step 3.) This is also your hit point maximum.

Record your character’s hit points on your character sheet. Also, record the type of Hit Die your character uses and the
number of Hit Dice you have. After you rest, you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see
<nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/missions#resting">Resting</nuxt-link> in the Missions section).

### Proficiency Bonus
The table that appears in your class description shows your proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level character.
Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the numbers you’ll be recording on your character sheet:

- Attack rolls using weapons you’re proficient with
- Attack rolls with spells you cast
- Ability checks using skills you’re proficient in
- Ability checks using tools you’re proficient with
- Saving throws you’re proficient in
- Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in each spellcasting class)

Your class determines your weapon proficiencies, your saving throw proficiencies, and some of your skill and tool proficiencies.
(Skills are described in <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/using-ability-scores">Using Ability Scores</nuxt-link>, tools
in <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/equipment#tools-kits">Equipment</nuxt-link>.) Your background gives you additional skill and
tool proficiencies, and some races give you more proficiencies. Be sure to note all of
these proficiencies, as well as your proficiency bonus, on your character sheet.

Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. Occasionally, your proficiency
bonus might be modified (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance suggests that your
proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll or that it should be multiplied more than once, you nevertheless
add it only once, multiply it only once, and halve it only once.

<strong>BUILDING KALEEM, STEP 2</strong><br>
Sam imagines Keleem firing tech spells from the safety of cover. She makes Kaleem an engineer and notes the engineers’
proficiencies and 1st-level class features on her character sheet.

As a 1st-level engineer, Kaleem has 1 Hit Die, a d8, and starts with hit points equal to 8 + her Constitution modifier.
Sam notes this and will record the final number after she determines Kaleem’s Constitution score (see step 3). Sam also
notes the proficiency bonus for a 1st-level character, which is +2.
