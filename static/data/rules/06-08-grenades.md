Grenades and mines provide various types of explosive mechanics to use in the heat of combat.

### Using a Grenade or Mine
Using a grenade is the same as using an item, requiring one Action.

### Armor Capacity: 2
All armor comes standard with 2 grenade slots. Some armor and mods allow you to increase this amount.

### Resupplying: ~500 credits per grenade
Grenades are a military resource, so, depending on your campaign setting they might be an uncommon or rare item. If your
character is part of a military outfit, you can resupply every time you return to base (or to your ship). Otherwise,
finding grenades may be a bit more difficult, requiring you to barter, steal, or loot them.

A recommended cost is 500-1000 credits per grenade or mine.

### Higher Marks
Grenades and Mines can range in power from Mark I to Mark X. Each grenade description describes the effect of higher marks.
It is recommended that each higher mark costs at least 1.5 times more credits than the previous mark: 

- I: 500
- II: 750
- III: 1,250
- IV: 1,800
- V: 2,500
- VI: 3,800
- VII: 5,700
- VIII: 8,500
- IX: 13,000
- X: 20,000
