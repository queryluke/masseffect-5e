Going on missions can involve delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of environmental hazards. The rules
in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places.

### Falling
A fall from a great height is a common hazard, especially since many urban environments reach the skies. At the end of a
fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 4 meters (~10 ft) it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature
lands prone unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.

### Suffocating
A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).

When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier
(minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can't regain hit
points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.

For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2
rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.

### Space <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip>
The vacuum of space will kill any organic (and most synthorganic creatures) in a matter of minutes unless that creature
has some specific resilience to surviving in a vacuum. A creature in the vacuum of space without an appropriate environmental
suit will remain conscious for a number of rounds equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum 1). After that time passes,
the creature immediate becomes incapacitated and it can survive in space a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution
modifier (minimum 1) after which it dies.

### Vision and Light
The most fundamental tasks of adventuring - noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and
targeting a biotic power, to name just a few - rely heavily on a character's ability to see. Darkness and other effects
that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.

A given area might be __lightly__ or __heavily obscured__. In a __lightly obscured__ area, such as dim light, patchy fog,
or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

A __heavily obscured__ area - such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage - blocks vision entirely. A creature
effectively suffers from the blinded condition when trying to see something in that area.

The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: __bright light__, __dim light__,
and __darkness__.

__Bright light__ lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do flashlights, fires, and
other sources of illumination within a specific radius.

__Dim light__, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between
a source of bright light, such as a flashlight, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts
as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon (or moons) might bathe the surface of a planet in dim light.

__Darkness__ creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night, within the confines of a derelict
starship, or a subterranean ruin.

#### Blindsight
A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures
without eyes, such as thresher maws, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and yaghs, have
this sense.

#### Darkvision
Some creatures have darkvision and some gear can provide darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision
can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that
creature is concerned. However, the creature can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

#### Truesight <v-chip color="orange accent-2" text-color="black" class="v-chip--x-small">change</v-chip>
A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal darkness, see invisible creatures and objects that
are hidden by technological means (such as tactical cloak).

#### Infrared vision <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip>
A creature with infrared vision, out to a specific range, can see in darkness, is unaffected by lightly or heavily obscured
areas, and see invisible and hidden creatures and objects that give off heat.

However, the creature cannot see beyond intense heat sources and is effectively blind when looking at an intense heat source.

### Food and Water
Characters who don't eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion. Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can't be
removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.

#### Food
A character needs about 500 grams (~ 1lb) of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations.
Eating 250 grams of food in a day counts as half a day without food.

A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the
end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion. A normal day of eating
resets the count of days without food to zero.

#### Water
A character needs 2 liters (~ 1/2 gallon) of water per day, or 4 liters per day if the weather is hot. A character who
drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at
the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end
of the day.

If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.

### Interacting with Objects
A character's interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM
that his or her character is doing something, such as interacting with a terminal, and the GM describes what, if anything,
happens.

For example, a character might decide to interact with a terminal, which might, in turn, open a door, raise an alarm, or
give the character access to a map of the building. If the terminal is protected via security, though, a character might need
to hack it. In such a situation, the GM might call for an Intelligence (Electronics) check to see whether the character can
bypass the security. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.

Characters can also damage objects with their weapons, biotics, and tech. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage,
but otherwise, they can be affected by physical attacks much as creatures can. The GM determines an object's Armor Class
and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks.
(It's hard to cut a cable with a hammer, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and
they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.

A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.
