### Name
Your character’s race description includes sample names for members of that race. Put some thought into your name even
if you’re just picking one from a list.

### Sex
You can play a male or female character without gaining any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how your
character does or does not conform to the broader culture’s expectations of sex, gender, and sexual behavior.

You don’t need to be confined to binary notions of sex and gender. For example, asari only have a single "gender", which
is generally seen by other races as female (they also utilize female pronouns). But an asari considers herself as androgynous
or hermaphroditic. You could also play a male character who presents himself as a female, a woman who feels trapped in
a male body, or a tough looking female krogan who hates being mistaken for a male. Likewise, your character’s
sexual orientation is for you to decide.

### Height and Weight
You can decide your character’s height and weight, using the information provided in your race description. Think about
what your character’s ability scores might say about his or her height and weight. A weak but agile character might be thin.
A strong and tough character might be tall or just heavy.

### Other Characteristics
You choose your character’s age and the color of his or her hair, eyes, and skin. To add a touch of distinctiveness,
you might want to give your character an unusual or memorable physical characteristic, such as a scar, a limp, or a tattoo.
