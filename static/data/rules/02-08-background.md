Every story has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals where you came from, how you became an operative, and
your place in the galaxy. Your soldier might have been a mercenary or a former Specter. Your adept could have been a
government experiment or a celebrated artisan. Your infiltrator might be a political assassin or gathered intel for the
Shadow Broker.

Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character’s identity. The most important question
to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring?
Where did you get the credits to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don’t you
have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?

A background also gives your character a background feature (a general benefit) and proficiency in two skills, and it might
also give you additional proficiency with certain kinds of tools. Record this information, along with the personality
information you develop, on your character sheet.
