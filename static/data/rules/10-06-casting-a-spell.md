title: 'Casting a Spell'

When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character's class, the type of spell,
or the spell's effects.

Each spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell's name, casting time, range, and duration.
Level and load are provided for biotic and tech spells, respectively.

The rest of a spell entry describes the spell's effect.



### Casting Time
Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or even longer to cast.
Combat spells can require an Attack action to cast.

#### Bonus Action
A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell,
provided that you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.

#### Reactions
Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response
to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.

#### Attack action
Many Combat spells have an action cost of Attack. This means you must use the Attack combat action to cast the spell. If
a spell or effect prevents you from taking the Attack action, you cannot cast the spell.

#### Longer Casting Times
Certain spells require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than
a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your
concentration while you do so. If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot or
spend tech points. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.



### Range
The target of a spell must be within the spell's range. For a spell like lance, the target is a creature. For a spell
like havoc strike, the target is the point in space where your character lands emitting a violent shockwave.

Most spells have ranges expressed in meters. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch.
Other spells, such as the fortification spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.

Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin
point of the spell's effect must be you.

Once a spell is cast, its effects aren't limited by its range, unless the spell's description says otherwise.



### Components <v-chip color="orange accent-2" text-color="black" class="v-chip--x-small">change</v-chip>
In Mass Effect 5e, all spells are Somatic, meaning they require some amount of gesturing. To cast any of the spell types
a caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.

There are no other spell components (such as verbal or material, as in D&D).



### Duration
A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or
even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.

#### Instantaneous
Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can't
be dispelled, because its effect exists only for an instant.

#### Concentration
Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep the effect going. This is the case with many biotics.
If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.

If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long
you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).

Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:

- __Casting another spell that requires concentration__. You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that
requires concentration. You can't concentrate on two spells at once.
- __Taking damage__. Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving
throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take
damage from multiple sources, such as a bullet and an engineer's salvo, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.
- __Being incapacitated or killed__. You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.
- The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as getting sucked out of an airlock, require you
to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.

### Targets
A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell's magic. A spell's description
tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).

#### A Clear Path to the Target
To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can't be behind total cover. If you place an area of effect
at a point that you can't see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes
into being on the near side of that obstruction.

#### Targeting Yourself
If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically
a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself. Areas of Effect
Spells such as singularity and snap freeze cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.



### Areas of Effect
Spells such as singularity and snap freeze cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.
A spell's description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube,
cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the spell's energy erupts.
The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in
space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.

A spell's effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point
of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn't included in the spell's area. To block one of
these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover.

#### Cone
A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone's width at a given point along its length is equal
to that point's distance from the point of origin. A cone's area of effect specifies its maximum length.

A cone's point of origin is not included in the cone's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

#### Cube
You select a cube's point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube's size is expressed as
the length of each side.

A cube's point of origin is not included in the cube's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

#### Cylinder
A cylinder's point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description.
The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight
lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell's effect then
shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.

A cylinder's point of origin is included in the cylinder's area of effect.

#### Line
A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.

A line's point of origin is not included in the line's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

#### Sphere
You select a sphere's point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere's size is expressed as
a radius in feet that extends from the point.

A sphere's point of origin is included in the sphere's area of effect.



### Saving Throws
Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell's effects. The spell specifies
the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.

The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.



### Attack Rolls
Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target.
Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.

Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll
if you are within 2 meters of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn't incapacitated.



### Casting in Armor
Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the
armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.
