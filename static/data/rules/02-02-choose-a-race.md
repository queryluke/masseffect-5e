title: '1. Choose a Race'
---

Every character belongs to a race, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the Mass Effect Universe. The most
common player character races are asari, humans, krogan, salarians, and turians. Some races also have subraces, such as
pure-blood asari or tank-bred krogan. The [Races](/phb/races) section provides more information about these races.

The race you choose contributes to your character’s identity in an important way, by establishing a general appearance
and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry. Your character’s race grants particular racial traits, such as
special senses, proficiency with certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability to use minor
spells. These traits sometimes dovetail with the capabilities of certain classes (see step 2). For example, the racial
traits of batarians make them exceptional soldiers, and asari tend to be powerful adepts. Sometimes playing against type
can be fun, too. salarian soldiers and krogan engineers, for example, can be unusual but memorable characters.

Your race also increases one or more of your ability scores, which you determine in step 3. Note these increases and
remember to apply them later.

Record the traits granted by your race on your character sheet. Be sure to note your base speed and size as well.

<h3>Galaxy Restrictions <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip></h3>
The available races to play are restricted to the Galaxy in which you set your campaign. The distinctions are based on
Bioware's lore. All races, with the exception of Angara, originated from the Milky Way Galaxy. And most races had an
<a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Ark#Arks" target="_blank">Ark</a> for transportation to the Andromeda galaxy.
And in some rare cases, a small group of a race may have found passage onboard and Ark. For example, a number of batarians
<a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Batarian_Scrapper" target="_blank">were recruited</a>
as security assets on Ark Paarchero. Therefore, most races are available in either setting. There are a few races that
we've deemed inappropriate for Andromeda settings, but the final ruling is at the discretion of your Galaxy Master.
See the <nuxt-link to="/phb/intro#universe-to-explore">A Universe to Explore</nuxt-link> section for more information about the two Galaxies.

<h3 class="mt-3">Class Restrictions <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip></h3>
In Mass Effect 5e, class options are restricted by the selected race because biotic abilities available to Adepts, Vanguards, and Sentinels are either rare or non-existent in certain races. Instead of making our own distinctions
about what races can play what classes, we used the race/class combinations available in the
<a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Mass_Effect_3_Multiplayer/Character_Customization" target="_blank">Mass Effect 3</a>
and <a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Mass_Effect:_Andromeda_Multiplayer#Character_Customization" target="_blank">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a>
multiplayer systems.

#### Recommendation, not Law
However, these restrictions should be considered a rule of thumb and are _not_ based on game balance. Therefore, you are
encouraged to talk to your Galaxy Masters about other race/class combinations and make your own decisions. If the decision
concerns whether or not a race can play as a biotic-capable class, the
<a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Biotics" target="_blank">Mass Effect Wiki's page about biotics</a> has
a breakdown of the biotic capabilities of each race. Specifically, the sections titled "Alien Biotics" and "Biotics in Andromeda."
If the decision is based on a different combination, feel free to use your own judgment.

<strong>BUILDING KALEEM, STEP 1</strong><br>
Sam is sitting down to create her character. She decides that a wiley salarian fits the character she wants to play and
she knows she wants to play with tech spells available to the engineer or infiltrator class, both of which are available
classes for the salarian race. She notes all the racial traits of salarians on her character sheet, including her speed
of 10m and Medium size.
