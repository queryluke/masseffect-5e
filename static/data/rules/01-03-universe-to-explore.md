title: A Universe to Explore

Mass Effect spans two galaxies: the Milky Way and Andromeda. Both have biotics, advanced tech, brave soldiers and fantastic
missions. But the galaxies are vastly different. The Milky Way has been settled by sentient beings for millennia and most of
its clusters, star systems, and planets have been charted and explored. It also is home to a variety of sentient alien species
all with their own culture, planets, and colonies, making up a vast galactic community. If you aren't familiar
with the first Mass Effect 3 video games, you can read about major events and lore at the
<a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Mass_Effect_Wiki" target="_blank">Mass Effect Wiki</a>. Specifically, the
<A href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline" target="_blank">timeline</a> can get you quickly up to speed to the events
of the galaxy.

The Andromeda Galaxy has a very different feeling. An ancient civilization of "Remnant" seem to exist on every planet, connected
by seemingly supernatural threads. Only two known sentient races existed in the Galaxy before the arrival of the Milky Way
races. Now the galaxy and its inhabitants are threatened by a widespread energy phenomenon called, The Scourge. The Milky Way
races arrived on Arks and are working to settle habitable planets around the galaxy and start a new life. If you'd like
to read more about the events of Mass Effect: Andromeda, <a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Mass_Effect:_Andromeda#Setting" target="_blank">
the wiki</a> has plenty of information.

Both galaxies share the same characteristics that are nascent to Mass Effect, i.e. biotics, tech, and space travel, but
each galaxy offers its own zeitgeist and challenges. The Milky Way is mostly explored and contains extensive urban environments.
You could easily set an entire campaign on a single planet and, depending on when you set your campaign
on the timeline, you might also deal with the impending invasion of <a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Reaper" target="_blank">the Reapers</a>.
In contrast, Andromeda is themed for exploration, survival, and being a pioneer. An operatives' primary goal is that of
setting up a thriving civilization in the new galaxy and uncovering its mysterious past. In short, the Milky Way
is an urban setting and Andromeda is rural.

Your GM might set the campaign on one of these galaxies or on a single planet that he or she created. Because there is so
much diversity among the galaxies in Mass Effect and so much unwritten lore, you should check with your GM about any house
rules that will affect your play of the game. Ultimately, the Galaxy Master is the authority on the campaign and its setting,
even if the setting is a published world.

<v-alert :value="true" type="info">
It is unlikely that your GM will have the campaign span between the two galaxies. The passengers of Andromeda's arks
spent 600 years in cryo-sleep. But you could certainly spend part of your campaign in the Milky Way and take a 600-year nap!
