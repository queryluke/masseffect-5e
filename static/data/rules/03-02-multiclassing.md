title: 'Multiclassing'
---

Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to
realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.

With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining
a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For
example, if you have three levels in engineer and two in sentinel, you're a 5th-level character.

As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another
class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start
progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you'll sacrifice some
focus in exchange for versatility.

### Prerequisites
To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your
new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a vanguard who decides to multiclass into
the infiltrator class must have both Dexterity and Intelligence scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training
that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that
is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.

### Experience Points
The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character
Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are an engineer 6/adept 1, you must gain enough XP
to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as an adept or your seventh level as an engineer.

### Hit Points and Hit Dice
You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a
class only when you are a 1st-level character.

You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same
die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the sentinel and the soldier have a d10, so if you are a
sentinel 5/soldier 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them
separately. If you are a sentinel 5/vanguard 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d12 Hit Dice.

### Proficiency Bonus
Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class. For example,
if you are a soldier 3/infiltrator 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3.

### Proficiencies
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class's starting
proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.

### Class Features
When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's
starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Barrier, Extra Attack, and Spellcasting.

<h4 class="mt-3 subheading">Barrier <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip></h4>
Your barrier capacity depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your
individual levels in those classes. You determine your barrier capacity by adding together all your levels in the
vanguard class and half your levels (rounded down) in the adept and sentinel classes. Use this total to determine your
barrier capacity by consulting the Multiclassing Barrier table.

<h4 class="mt-3 subheading">Extra Attack</h4>
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make
more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the soldier's version of Extra Attack does).

<h4 class="mt-3 subheading">Spellcasting <v-chip color="orange accent-2" text-color="black" class="v-chip--x-small">change</v-chip></h4>

__Spells known and prepared__: You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually as if you were a single-classed member
of that class. If you are an adept 4/engineer 3, for example, you know six 1st-level adept spells and five adept cantrips
based on your levels in the adept class. As a 3rd-level engineer, you can prepare 3 engineer spells. If your Intelligence
is 16, you can prepare six engineer spells.

Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that
class when you cast the spell.

You can only use spell slots to cast biotic spells and you can only use tech points to cast tech spells. The exception
is Sentinels that can use their spell slots to cast biotic or tech spells.

__Biotic Spell Slots__: You determine your available spell slots and cantrips by adding together all your
levels in the adept class and half your levels (rounded down) in the sentinel and vanguard classes. Use this total to determine
your spell slots and cantrips by consulting the Multiclassing Biotics table.

<ai-dialog title="Multiclassing Biotics table" component="multiclassing-biotics-table"></ai-dialog>

<br>

__Tech Points & Tech Point Limit__ You determine your tech points and tech point limit by adding together all
your levels in the engineer class and half your levels (rounded down) in the infiltrator class. Use this
total to determine your tech points and memory by consulting the Multiclassing Tech table.
