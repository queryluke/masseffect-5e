Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.

### Strength Checks

A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or
to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.

- __*Other Strength Checks*__. The GM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
  - Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door
  - Break free of bonds
  - Push through a tunnel that is too small
  - Hang on to a hover car while being dragged behind it
  - Tip over a dormant mech
  - Restraining an elcor

### Attack Rolls and Damage
You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as
an omni-hammer, a monomolecular blade, or a krogan warhammer. Additionally, ranged weapon marked with the _Recoil_ property
allow you to overcome the kickback of the weapon with brute force. You may apply your Strength modifier to your attack roll
and damage roll when attacking with _Recoil_ weapons.

### Lifting and Carrying <v-chip color="orange accent-2" text-color="black" class="v-chip--x-small">change</v-chip>

Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.
These weights have been adjusted from 5th Edition to work with kilograms (kg) instead of pounds (lbs).
\
__Carry Capacity__. You can carry capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 5. If you are wearing armor, your carry
capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 10 (due to the built-in servos and pneumatics). This score is not affected
by weapons or armor (see below).
\
__Push, Drag, Lift__. You can push, drag, or lift a weight in kgs up to twice your carrying capacity or 10 (20 w/ armor)
times your Strength score. While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 2 meters.
\
__Size & Strength__. Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category
above Medium, double the creature's carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.
\
__Weapons__. You have 2 weapon slots and can equip a single weapon in either slot. Weapons equipped in a slot do not
affect your carry capacity. Any additional weapons you pick up count against your carry capacity.
\
__Armor__. The Armor Bonuses and Limitations table has a minimum Strength score for the combination of armor types. You
must meet or exceed that score.

### Variant: Encumbrance <v-chip color="orange accent-2" text-color="black" class="v-chip--x-small">change</v-chip>

The lifting and carrying rules attempt to keep the simplicity of 5th edition, with the added restrictions of weapon capacity.
Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment.
When you use this variant, ignore the minimum Strength column of the Armor table and ignore the weapon slot limitation.

- __Your carry weight is equal to two times your Strength score__
- Each weapon and armor piece has a weight. If your total weight from all weapons and armor is in excess of your
  carry weight, you are __encumbered__, which means your speed drops by 4m.
- If your total weight from all weapons and armor is in excess of four times your Strength score, you are instead
  __heavily encumbered__, which means your speed drops by 10m and you have disadvantage on ability
  checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.
