Systems are the semi-independent functions that make-up the overall operation of the vehicle. But systems also refer
or a "place" within the vehicle where crucial operations must be performed. For example, to pilot the vehicle,
you typically have to be at the helm, and to fire the weapons, you have to be at the terminal that controls the cannons
or targeting system. In some cases, a vehicle might have a __combined system__, e.g. _Helm/Navigation/SSC_. When two
or more systems are combined, operatives can access their functions from a single (or sometimes multiple) locations.

### Helm
The helm is the pilot seat. Players at the helm are able to take the Maneuver action, which can temporarily increase the
AC of their starship or vehicle, representing the pilot’s ability to evade oncoming attacks.

### Navigation
A starships navigation system is necessary to plot jumps between Mass Effect Relays. More about using your ships
navigation can be found in the Travelling the Galaxy section below.

### Weapons
Players must be at the weapons system to take the Attack action in combat. Weapon damage for vehicles has a x10 modifier.
Starships have a x100 modifier.

### EWS (Electronic Warfare Suite)
The ships EWS protects the vehicle from hacking attempts but also allows the crew to attempt to hack other ships.
Players must be at the EWS system to take the Harden or Sabotage action in combat.

### SSC (Sensors, Scanners, and Communications)
Every vehicle comes with at least some modicum of sensors, scanners, and communication systems. Sensors and scanners
allow players to scan planets and satellites for composites and valuable materials. Comms allow the vehicle to hail
other ships and planets. Players must be at the Sensors systems to take the Scan action during combat.

### Drive
The drive and engineering deck are the heart of the ship. Damage to a ship’s drive can render it immobile and shut down
other vital systems. Players at the Engineering system can attempt the Restore action in combat.

### Additional Systems & Upgrades
Starships can have additional systems on board, such as improved quarters, workshops, and labs. Starship systems
can also be upgraded. The Ship Upgrades table provides a list of common systems and system upgrades.

Some systems provide a list of Downtime Activities, meaning players can participate in one of the Downtime Activity
listed while on board the ship during a long rest. The Downtime Training has a list of tool and/or weapon proficiencies
that can be learned from participating in the <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/missions#between-missions">Downtime Activity: Training</nuxt-link>.

Adding a new system or installing an upgrade takes 8 hours of uninterrupted work. You can either pay a skilled
hireling for a days work or you can make the upgrades yourself.

### Maintaining Systems
Every system requires maintenance, and vehicle systems are no different. For larger vehicles, like starships,
your maintenance is generally performed by your __crew__. Every system requires at least 16 hours of maintenance per month.
Maintenance can be performed by a skilled hireling for 3000 credits over 2 long rests, or over time by a dedicated crew
member (as discussed below).

#### Replacing systems
If a system breaks and must be replaced, you lose any benefits that system provides until your replace it. Replacing a 
broken system costs 300,000 or the price of the system in the ship upgrades table, whichever is lower.
