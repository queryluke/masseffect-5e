Regardless of how many biotic spells knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells before resting.
Manipulating the gravitational forces into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells
are even more so. Thus, each biotic class's description includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level
a character can use at each character level.

When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell's level or higher, effectively "filling" a slot
with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size - small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a
spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 4th-level spell fits only in a 4th-level slot.
So when an adept casts lance, a 1st-level spell, he or she spends one 1st-level slot.

Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots.

### Casting at a Higher Level
When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level
for that casting. For instance, if an operative casts lance using one of their 2nd-level slots, that lance is 2nd level.

Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.

Some spells, such as lance and first ait, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a
spell's description.

### Tech Points <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip>
In Mass Effect 5e, certain classes can use tech points to cast spells. Tech points represent the internal power of
the operative's omni-tool. As the operative levels, the gain more tech points, representing the time they spend
modifying their omni-tool and optimizing subroutines.

When a character casts a spell with tech points, he or she expends, at minimum, one tech point per spell's level:
1 tech point for 1st-level, 2 tech points for 2nd level, etc. You can think of a tech point as a 1st-level spell slot that
can be added to other tech points to create a spell slot of a higher level. The number of tech points you can spend
on a spell is limited by your class's level, indicated in the class's progression table.

Finishing a long rest restores any expended tech points.
