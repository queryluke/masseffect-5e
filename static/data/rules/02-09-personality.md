Fleshing out your character’s personality — the array of traits, mannerisms, habits, beliefs, and flaws that give a person
a unique identity — will help you bring him or her to life as you play the game. Four categories of characteristics are
presented here: personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about your character’s
favorite words or phrases, tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and whatever else you can imagine.

Each background presented later in this section includes suggested characteristics that you can use to spark your
imagination. You’re not bound to those options, but they’re a good starting point.

### Personality Traits
Give your character two personality traits. Personality traits are small, simple ways to help you set your character apart
from every other character. Your personality traits should tell you something interesting and fun about your character.
They should be self-descriptions that are specific about what makes your character stand out.
“I’m smart” is not a good trait, because it describes a lot of characters. “I’ve read every book in on the Exonet” tells
you something specific about your character’s interests and disposition.

Personality traits might describe the things your character likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your character
dislikes or fears, your character’s self-attitude or mannerisms, or the influence of his or her ability scores.

A useful place to start thinking about personality traits is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores and define
one trait related to each. Either one could be positive or negative: you might work hard to overcome a low score, for example,
or be cocky about your high score.

### Ideals
Describe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals are the things that you believe in most strongly, the fundamental
moral and ethical principles that compel you to act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your life goals to your core belief system.

Ideals might answer any of these questions: What are the principles that you will never betray? What would prompt you to
make sacrifices? What drives you to act and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single most important thing you strive for?

You can choose any ideals you like, but your character’s alignment is a good place to start defining them. Each background
includes six suggested ideals. Five of them are linked to aspects of alignment: law, chaos, good, evil, and neutrality.
The last one has more to do with the particular background than with moral or ethical perspectives.

### Bonds
Create one bond for your character. Bonds represent a character’s connections to people, places, and events in the world.
They tie you to things from your background. They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead you to act against
your own best interests if they are threatened. They can work very much like ideals, driving a character’s motivations
and goals.

Bonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do you care most about? To what place do you feel a special connection?
What is your most treasured possession?

Your bonds might be tied to your class, your background, your race, or some other aspect of your character’s history or
personality. You might also gain new bonds over the course of your missions.

### Flaws
Finally, choose a flaw for your character. Your character’s flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or weakness —
in particular, anything that someone else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act against your best interests.
More significant than negative personality traits, a flaw might answer any of these questions: What enrages you?
What’s the one person, concept, or event that you are terrified of? What are your vices?

<strong>BUILDING KALEEM, STEP 4.D</strong><br>
Sam has a pretty clear picture of Kaleem’s personality in mind, so she skips the personality traits suggested in the scrapper
background, noting instead that Kaleem is aloof and soft-spoken. She is distrustful of strangers but fiercely loyal to her friends.
She chooses the ideal of change from the list in her background, noting that Kaleem believes that the only constant in the universe
is change.

Given her history, Kaleem’s bond is obvious: she owes her life to the Blue Suns. Her flaw is that she lacks empathy which
has caused her to do some morally questionable deeds without thinking twice.
