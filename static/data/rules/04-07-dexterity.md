Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.

### Dexterity Checks
A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing.
The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, Stealth and Vehicle Handling skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.

- __*Other Dexterity Checks*__. The GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
  - Disable a tripwire mine
  - Securely tie up a prisoner
  - Wriggle free of bonds
  - Play a stringed instrument
  - Craft a small or detailed object

### Attack Rolls and Damage
You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as an
assault rifle or a sub-machine gun (SMG). You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage
roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the _finesse_ property, such as an omni-blade or a monomolecular blade.

### Armor Class
Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.

### Initiative
At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of
creatures' turns in combat.

### Hiding
The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check.
Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any
creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.

You can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as
shouting a warning or bumping into a crate. An _invisible_ creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still
be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.

In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature,
it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature
that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.

__Passive Perception__. When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine
whether such a creature notices you, the GM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature's passive Wisdom
(Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the
creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency
bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception)
of 14.

__What Can You See?__ One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how
well you can see in an area, which might be _lightly_ or _heavily obscured_.
