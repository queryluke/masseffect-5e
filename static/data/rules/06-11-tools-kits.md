A tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or hack
a security system. Your race, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a
tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to
a single ability since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use.

Mass Effect 5e utilizes the Tool Proficiency rules found in Xanathar's Guide to Everything (pg. 78). In summary, it's
unclear when a player should use a tool proficiency and a skill proficiency. The rule of thumb is that tools have
specific applications whereas skills are very broad, but this limits the use of tools.

Thus, to make tool proficiencies more attractive, Xanathar's Guide to Everything added benefits to combining tools with
skills. The first is that combining a tool with a skill gives the player advantage when making the skill check.
The second benefit is that tools provide additional non-combat features.

__Advantage or Added Benefit__. When the character combines their tool proficiency with a skill, they gain _additional insight_ 
which means the operative either gains advantage on the skill check or they can gain an added benefit, decided by the GM. 

For example, a character that is proficient with Hacking Tools gains advantage when combining their tool proficiency
with an Intelligence (Investigation) check when utilizing networked systems (like the exonet) or they might gain
an added benefit, such as finding some additional information or key codes.

__Unique Skill__. Operatives proficient in a tool have a unique activity they can perform during a short or long rest.
For example, a character proficient with Armorsmith's Workbench can craft armor or attempt to remove mods. 

__Sample Activities__. Each tool also has sample activity DCs. These are examples and not an exhaustive list. GMs can adjust
DCs or create new activities as they see fit. These activities require a skill check, but the skill used is up to the GM.
For example, an operative proficient with hacking tools can disable a security system. This would likely require an
Intelligence (Electronics) check, but if the security system required splicing wires, it might require a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)
check instead.
