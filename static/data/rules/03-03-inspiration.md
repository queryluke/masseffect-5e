Inspiration is a rule the galaxy master can use to reward you for playing your character in a way that’s true to his or
her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw.

### Gaining Inspiration
Your GM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, GMs award it when you play out your
personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your character in a
compelling way. Your GM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in the game.

You either have inspiration or you don’t - you can’t stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use.

### Using Inspiration
If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending your
inspiration gives you advantage on that roll.

Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply
doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does something that really contributes to the story
in a fun and interesting way, you can give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration.
