title: 'Lifestyle Expenses'
---

Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in the galaxy. They cover your
accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your
equipment so you can be ready when mission next calls.

At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Lifestyle Expenses table and pay the price to
sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over
a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on
the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character's career.

Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the
rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid
criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.

__Wretched__. You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into
transit tunnels, huddling in alleyways, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A
wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched
people covet your armor, weapons, and gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice
of most people.

__Squalid__. You live in the slums, a condemned building, a repurposed shipping container, or a roach-infested boarding
house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent
environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you
have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be
disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.

__Poor__. A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings,
threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your
accommodations might be a room in a rundown apartment, the basement dwelling of a business, or the bunker of a faction.
You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this
lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.

__Modest__. A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in
an older part of the city, renting a room in a crowded apartment. You don't go hungry or thirsty, and your living
conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students,
service workers.

__Comfortable__. Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your
equipment. You live in a nice apartment in a middle-class neighborhood or in a small townhouse. You associate with
shopkeepers, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.

__Wealthy__. Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social
status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly
successful small business owner, a politician, or a doctor. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a
good part of town or a comfortable suite at the top level of an apartment building. You likely have a small staff of workers
to maintain your home or run day to day errands.

__Aristocratic__. You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in
the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a mansion in the nicest part of town or a luxurious suite. You dine
at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have workers attending to your every need.
You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful and spend evenings in the company of politicians,
community leaders, and other elite persons. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The
wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.

### Self Sufficiency

The expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are spending your time between adventures on an advanced planet
in a city or town, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford - paying for food and lodging, paying
skilled workers to mend your armor or service your weapons, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend
their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.

Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn't require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your
time between adventures practicing a profession, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in
Survival the skill lets you live at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.
