All vehicles share some of the same basic features.

### Armor Class
AC for vehicles works exactly the same as in the <nuxt-link to="/phb/equipment#armor">basic 5e rules</nuxt-link>.

### Hull Points (hit points)
This represents how much damage a vehicle or starship can take before it is destroyed.

### Shield Points
Shields for vehicles and starships work generally the same as in the main <nuxt-link to="/phb/combat#shields"/>ME5e rules</nuxt-link>,
with a notable exception: Vehicle shields can only be regenerated in combat when players attempt the
Restore action (explained later in this section).

### Speed
For vehicles, speed is relative to other vehicles and is represented as a static number not as meters. For
the purposes of combat, it represents the number of playmat spaces the vehicle can move on its turn when moving
at a normal pace.

### Range
Range represents how far the vehicle can travel in one 24 period. For starships, range is represented in "Faster-than-light-units"
or FTLUs and is used in conjunction with
the Galaxy Map. Each line indicates the travel time between star systems, which you subtract from the starships range.
Travel to planets within a star systems costs 1 range. You can read more about range for starships in the
<nuxt-link to="/phb/vehicles#travelling-the-galaxy">Traveling the Galaxy section</nuxt-link>

### Minimum Crew
The number of crew required for the vehicle to operate. In some cases, at the GM’s discretion, it may be possible to
operate a vehicle with less than the minimum required number of crew. Rolls made to operate vehicles in these conditions
will most likely be made at disadvantage, again at the GM’s discretion.

### Crew Capacity
The total number of sentient organisms that a ship can accommodate. This is a combination of active crew and any passengers.
In some cases, this number can be expanded by using cargo capacity, below.

### Cargo Capacity
How much “stuff” a vehicle can hold. This is measured in Megagrams (also known as a “tonne” or “metric ton”).

__1 Mg = 1,000 kg = 2,204 lbs.__

This will be rounded to the nearest 0.5 mg (500 kg). When calculating cargo
capacity, we suggest using this as a guideline to estimate cargo capacity rather than getting bogged down in specific
calculations. For points of reference, a small hatchback car weighs just over 1 Mg while the largest tanker ships
in the world have a capacity of over 200,000 Mg.

### Systems
__Systems__ refer to a number of semi-independent functions that make-up the overall operation of a vehicle. These are
things like navigation, communications, weapons array, etc. These are used to simulate the cooperative effort involved
in operating larger, complex vessels, and player characters will often be called upon to make skill-based rolls to
operate these individual systems. Generally speaking, small vehicles, especially those with only a single crew member,
will not have designated systems.

### Weapons
__Weapons__, in many cases, will refer to a specific system or systems on a vehicle. Vehicle-mounted weapons will
typically have a multiplier after their damage roll to represent how powerful they are. For example, a cruiser’s mass
accelerator cannon has a damage roll of 2d6[x100] and an M35 Mako’s coaxial machine-gun has a damage roll of 2d6[x10].
In these situations, you roll and add damage dice and any bonuses as usual. After you have determined your result,
multiply the total by the amount indicated. In our example, if both weapons roll a __7__ for their damage, the cruiser
deals __700__ damage and the Mako deals __70__.

### Size

Most transports use the standard size categories: Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. However,
starships can become truly colossal and have 4 additional categories.

__Frigates__ are light transport vehicles, usually used for exploration, transportation of small squads, privately
funded excursions, or stealth transport. The Normandy is an example of a frigate. Frigates can land on planets and
typically host a crew of 5-20.

__Cruisers__ are middleweight ships that can either transport large amounts of supplies from place to place or focus on
firepower. Military cruisers tend to be the front-line of the battle and have powerful weapons, shields, and armor.
Cruisers typically have crews of 20 - 100 and are able to land on planets.

__Carriers__, also called _freighters_,
are large ships meant to carry transports (starfighters and dropships). Carriers are primarily military
in nature though some venture capitalists have used carriers for mining operations and colonizing efforts. Carriers are
typically weak in combat, being slow and lacking much firepower or shielding. Instead, carriers utilize their transports
for offense and defense. Carriers are built in space and are too large to land on planets (purposefully). Instead, most
carriers use drop ships for planetary exploration. Carriers can support crews in the hundreds.

__Dreadnoughts__ are the largest class of ship, generally a kilometer or more long with incredible firepower that’s
harnessed in the main cannon which is able to decimate entire cities, squads of enemy fighters, and other dreadnoughts. Dreadnoughts
are meant for extended life in space, usually hosting a crew in the thousands and a self-sustaining ecosystem of shops,
leisure activities, police force, politics, etc. Think of dreadnaughts as a small town floating through space. The arks
of Andromeda were dreadnoughts as are the Liveships that the quarian race inhabits. The ships are so costly to make
that the total number of dreadnoughts in the Milky Way is less than 200 with most races having only one or none. It’s
impossible to land Dreadnoughts on planets safely.

### Cost
The costs listed for vehicles represent their market value. Some vehicles, instead, are __military__ meaning the vehicles
cannot be purchased on the open market. Instead, characters will need inside connects, the black market, or luck
to acquire these vehicles.

### CR
Transports have a CR between 0 and 30, which is based on its hp, ac, and damage. Starships have a __+__ symbol after
their CR, which indicates that this CR is a relative representation based on other starships. It is unlikely that operatives
will destroy a starship with traditional weapons. Instead, they'll likely have to use other vehicles. For example,
a starship with a CR of __12+__ has the same XP reward as a level CR creature when the operatives destroy it
using other vehicles. If operatives did manage to destroy the vehicle using traditional means, we recommend
providing XP equal to the standard amount multiplied by 10. For example, a cr 12 creature provides 8,400 XP. If players
destroyed this with traditional means, the GM can reward 84,000 XP.
