With the Variant: Paragon & Renegade (P/R) rule, players accrue points in either Paragon or Renegade which can add
bonuses to skill checks.

### Earning Points
The primary way to each Paragon or Renegade points is by taking actions or role-playing that personality. This mechanic
works similarly rewarding Inspiration (described above), but the reward can be 1-5 points based on the impact of the
choice and whether the choice aligns with Paragon or Renegade. GMs can also reward points to the entire party based on a
decision they make while playing the game. Did the party destroy the potentially life-threatening biological weapon
(Renegade) or send it to authorities for research in vaccinations (Paragon).

### Point maximum
You can gain points in Paragon and Renegade, but your total combined points can never be more than 100.
For Galaxy Masters, you want to award about 5 points of paragon or renegade per player level. I.e., a level 20 character
should have about 100 points if they added their P/R scores together.

### Using points
Your Paragon and Renegade points can add a bonus to skill checks. You gain a +1 bonus to your skill check for every
10 Paragon or Renegade points you have. For example, if you had 14 Paragon points and 22 Renegade points, you would
add +1 to any paragon rolls and +2 to any renegade rolls.

A Paragon or Renegade roll is any skill check in which your GM allows your P/R bonus to augment the outcome of the roll.
It's the player's responsibility to ask the Galaxy Master about adding the P/R bonus, but the Galaxy Master can
proactively ask for a check with the P/R bonus added.

When to or when not to apply P/R bonus to a roll is entirely up to the GM. However, the rule of thumb is that the
action taken is more Paragon-like or more Renegade-like than what an average sentient being would do.

### Paragon vs Renegade
What constitutes Paragon and what constitutes Renegade is a bit fuzzy. Paragon is neither Lawful nor Good, just as Renegade
is neither Evil nor Chaotic. However, both traits _tend_ to fall closer to those respective spectra.

Try to think of Paragon and Renegade flavors of a character's or party's choices. Paragon choices are open-ended,
allowing for future possibilities, utilitarian (benefits the most people), logical, and rely on the pen over the sword.
Renegade choices are decisive and final, emotional, gain immediate results, and often use a show of force.

#### Paragon examples
- Acrobatics: jump in front of a bullet to protect someone
- Athletics: Hold fast a door why your party escapes a threat
- Intimidation: Threaten someone with justice
- Medicine: Stabilize an enemy because they might provide information
- Vehicle Handling: Lead your chasers right to the authorities

#### Renegade examples
- Athletics: Hold fast a door so the threat burns inside
- Deception: Convince the bounty hunters their target fled into that cave (which happens to be booby-trapped)
- Electronics: Broadcast the controversial research to the galaxy, let the politicians and scientists figure it out
- Intimidation: Threaten someone with pain
- Vehicle Handling: Lead your chasers right into a reinforced-steel wall
