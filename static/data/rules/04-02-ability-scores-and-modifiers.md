title: 'Ability Scores and Modifiers'

Each of a creature's abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not
just a measure of innate capabilities but also encompasses a creature's training and competence in activities related
to that ability.

A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but operatives and many monsters are a cut above average in most
abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. operatives can have scores as high as 20, and
monsters can have scores as high as 30.

Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a
score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores,
from 1 to 30.
