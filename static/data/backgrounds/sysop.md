### Suggested Characteristics
A system operator (Sysop) is a catch-all term for people who monitor, maintain, and upgrade the plethora of vital systems
that support civilized life. From entertainment to traffic to waste management, sysops either Virtual Intelligence software (VIs)
or manually maintain code. Long hours of staring at code and constant need to keep systems up-to-date, running, and protected
from security breaches typically make paranoid or uneasy individuals who romanticize seemingly mundane events, tasks,
and social situations.
