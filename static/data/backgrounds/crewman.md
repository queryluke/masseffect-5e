__Skill Proficiencies__. Electronics and Engineering

__Tool Proficiencies__. Two starship systems of your choice.

__Equipment__. A pressurized space suit, a set of common clothes, a gaming set, and 1000 credits.

__Feature: Transport's Passage__. When you need to, you can secure free passage on a starship for yourself and your adventuring
companions. You might voyage on the ship you served on, or another ship you have good relations with (perhaps one captained
by a former crewmate). Because you're calling in a favor, you can't be certain of a schedule or route that will meet your
every need. Your Galaxy Master will determine how long it takes to get where you need to go. In return for your free passage,
you and your companions are expected to assist the crew during the voyage.
