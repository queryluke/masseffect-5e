__Feature: Safe Haven__. As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and other agents who can
provide assistance. You know a set of secret signs, encrypted communication channels, and passwords you can use to identify
such agents, who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information.
These agents never risk their lives for you or risk revealing their true identities.

__Faction__. As a faction agent, you're part of a larger faction, which could be criminal, military, religious, political, etc.
You can work with your GM to create a faction or you can use an existing one from the Mass Effect Universe. Some faction
examples are the Shadow Broker Network, Blue Suns, Special Tasks Group, Cerberus, Eclipse, and the Blood Pack. Agents
are more than hired mercenaries and are supportive of their faction's efforts.

### Suggested Characteristics
Faction Agents are shaped by their experience in the line of duty. The beliefs, laws, and practices of their faction can
affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy that counteracts the tenets of their faction.
For example, a Shadow Broker Agent that secretly wants transparency of information. Or they might have an ideal or bond
that is taken to an extreme, such as a Cerberus agent that hates all non-human races and kills them whenever possible.
