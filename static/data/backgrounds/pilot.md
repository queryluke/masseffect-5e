### Suggested Characteristics
The scale of a pilot's travels could be limited to a single planet, system, or across the entire galaxy. But all pilots
are most comfortable on the move and never stay in one place very long, always seeking a new adventure or experience.

4 | I will always give my opinion, even if others don't ask for it.
5 | I see genuine quality is seemingly defunct transports and ships.
6	| Once you've crossed me, you'll never gain my trust again.
