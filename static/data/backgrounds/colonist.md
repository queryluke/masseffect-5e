### Suggested Characteristics
A colonist is generally not far traveled and has lived most their life on a single planet. However, colonies can vary in size,
governmental structure, and socioeconomic status. Colonists see their humble origins as a virtue, not a shortcoming,
and their home communities remain very important to them.
