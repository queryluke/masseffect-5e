__Feature: By Popular Demand__. You can always find a place to perform, from the slums of Omega to the grand theatres of
the Citadel. You receive free lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard (depending
on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you
something of a local figure. When strangers recognize you in a city district or colony where you have performed, they typically
take a liking to you.

__Specialty__. A good entertainer is versatile, spicing up every performance with a variety of different routines. Choose
one to three routines or roll on the table below to define your expertise as an entertainer.
