Referred to colloquially as a "shuttle", "skycar", or "aircar", the X3M is a contragravity speeder designed for
transporting individuals in metropolises and space stations. Shuttles are compartmentalized into a pilot/passenger
compartment and a propulsive drive compartment. In the pilot/passenger compartment, there are four seats with one of
them reserved for the pilot. From either the forward left or right seat, a pilot controls the shuttle's movements
through the use of a haptic adaptive interface. The canopy of the shuttle is divided into two sections - a central
section which lifts up, and a clamshell door. The windows of the vehicle can be darkened for the privacy of the
passengers. Due to the limited storage space, passengers are limited to what they can carry or store on their bodies.
To the rear of this compartment, there is the propulsive drive powered by a mass effect field.

X3Ms come in a variety of models. Some are smaller with only 1 or 2 seats like the Tess Auburn 2166 aircar. Models
like the C-111 Skyline Shuttle are meant for public transportation and can carry up to 10 passengers. Some models
are meant for driving enthusiasts with increased handling and acceleration, like the Mark II Blackout or Esquiran
Sporting Shuttle.
