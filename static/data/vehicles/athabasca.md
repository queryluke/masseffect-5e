The Athabasca Class is a class of large freighter of human origin. Externally, this freighter class's configuration may
be mistaken for the smaller Kowloon Class freighters. However, the Athabasca Class freighter is a multi-level voluminous
starship. The Athabasca Class freighter is lightly armored and lacks armaments, and can be attacked and boarded very
quickly. This freighter class is equipped with a self-destruct device and a black box.

__Additional Systems__: The Athabasca-class has 30 system slots. They vary widely and can be customized to fit the needs
of most businesses.

__Hanger__: Athabasca-class carriers can be equipped with a hanger (taking up 10 system slots). The hanger can hold up to
50 interceptors or fighters.
