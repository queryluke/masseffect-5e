Your blood rage is exceptionally deadly, rivaling those of the krogan warlords in Tuchanka. You gain the 
following benefits while using your Blood Rage trait:

- Once per turn when you roll damage for a melee weapon attack, you can reroll the weaponâ€™s damage dice and use either total.
- As a bonus action, you can move up to your speed toward an enemy of your choice that you can see or hear. You must end this move closer to the enemy than you started.
- When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one additional damage dice and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.
