You know just what to say in a tight situation. As a bonus action, you can inspire all allies within earshot to instantly roll a hit die and regain that many hit points. This does not expend a hit die from their pool. Allies immediately recover from the following conditions: {charmed}, {frightened}, {frozen}, {grappled}, {incapacitated}, {paralyzed}, {poisoned}, {prone}, {restrained}, and {stunned}. You may use this ability once per short rest.
