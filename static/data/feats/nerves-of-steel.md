Traveling the galaxy has exposed you to violence and cruelty, been deceived and seen almost every trick in the book. Not 
much can make you flinch anymore. You gain the following benefits and features:

- You have advantage on all saving throws made to resist becoming charmed, frightened, and stunned.
- While charmed, frightened, or stunned, you can use a bonus action on your turn to repeat the saving throw to end the 
  effect. This saving throw is not made with advantage.
