Krogan are notorious for using any weapon within reach - even the armored plates that cover their foreheads. 
You gain the following benefits:

- You can attack with a headbutt, which is a natural weapon that you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with 
it, you deal 1d6 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage.
- When you use the Dash action during your turn, you can make a melee attack with your headbutt as a bonus action.
