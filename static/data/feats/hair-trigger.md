You've mastered Double Tap weapons.

- Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- When wielding only one Double Tap weapon, you may make a second ranged attack on the same target as your first
ranged attack as a free action. You may do this once per turn.
- When you use your bonus action to make a ranged attack with a Double Tap weapon, you add your ability modifier to the damage roll.
