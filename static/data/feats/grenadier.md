- +2 grenade capacity
- __Improvised Grenades__. You can make grenades from scrap metal and scavenged materials. Acquire 1 frag grenade every long rest.
The Mark of the frag grenade is equal to your level divided by three, minimum 1.

When you use a grenade, you may choose to make a ranged weapon attack (10/30m) on a creature instead of choosing a target location.
Add your dexterity or strength modifier (your choice) and proficiency bonus to the attack roll. On a hit, the grenade
deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + dexterity or strength modifier (same as used to make the ranged attack). The target
also has disadvantage on the saving throw caused by the grenade. The grenade lands at the target's location.
On a miss, the grenade lands 2m beyond the target. On a critical miss, roll 2d4. The first die represents the number of
spaces away from the target in which the grenade lands. The second die represents the direction (1 = North, 2= East,
3 = South, 4 = West). E.g., 2 & 2, the grenade would land 2 spaces east of the target. Once the grenade's location is
determined, it resolves normally.
