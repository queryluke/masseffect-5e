At 1st level, you know one combat power of your choice from the soldier spell list. You learn additional combat powers of
your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Combat Powers column of the Soldier table.

Instead of learning a new combat power, you may instead learn the advanced version of a combat power you already know.
