### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the adept spell list. You learn additional adept cantrips of
your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Adept table.

Instead of learning a new cantrip, you may instead learn the advanced version of a cantrip you already know.

### Spell Slots
The Adept table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these
adept spells, you must expend a slot of the spellâ€™s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish
a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell lance and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can
cast lance using either slot.

### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the adept spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Adept table shows when you learn more adept spells of your choice. Each of these spells
must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn
one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the adept spells you know and learn an advanced
version of it. You select one of the advancement options listed in the spell description. Whenever you cast the spell,
you cast the advanced version of it. You can only learn one advancement for each spell.

### Spellcasting Ability

Adepts have an L5x biotic implant which requires conscious control over their nervous system. As an Adept, you use your
Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the
saving throw DC for a biotic spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

__Spell save DC__ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

__Spell attack modifier__ = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
