Each hostile creature that hears the phrase much pass a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature becomes unnerved by the phrase and can only target the LOKI mech when making attack rolls or using damaging spells. On a success, a creature is unaffected and is immune to the LOKI mech's Chatter. The DC of the saving throw is dependant on the phrase, but cannot be higher than 12."
