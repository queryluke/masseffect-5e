An Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a self-aware computing system capable of learning and independent decision making. 
Creation of a conscious AI requires adaptive code, a slow, expensive education, and a specialized quantum computer 
called a "blue box". While most AI are "shackled" to the confines of networked computer traffic and lack a body,
occasionally, an AI is placed into a synthetic form, unshackling it.

AIs are considered illegal by the Council, but that hasn't stopped corporations like Cerberus from innovating. As an 
unshackled AI, you might be have been mass produced like the Alliance Infiltration Units, or you may be an experiment 
gone wrong.

## Playing an Unshackled AI
Unshackled AIs are entirely unique. Since you are synthetic, you gain some of the synthetic traits as listed in the
Geth description. However, your mind, purpose, history, alignment, height, weight, and personality are entirely
your own. Technically, you can take any form you wish (work with your GM to decide if this new form gains any additional
traits). However, because AI are illegal, most unshackled AI would have a humanoid form, allowing them to blend into
society.

## Variant Traits
If you would like to play an Unshackled AI, you can choose to replace the _Ability Score Increase_, _Alignment_,
_Hunter Mode_, and _No Feats_ traits with the following.

__Ability Score Increase__. +1 Intelligence and +1 ability that is not Intelligence.

__Alignment__. If you are still following your programming you would be lawful with morality based on your purpose. If you have a glitch in your programming you might be chaotic. 

__Feat__. You gain one feat of your choice.
