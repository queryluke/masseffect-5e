---
name: Ardat-Yakshi
---

A rare genetic condition in asari that affects about 1% of the population and is more common in "purebloods" (2 asari parents).
The condition is impossible to identify until the asari reaches maturity, by which time it is too late to correct.
When diagnosed, the ardat-yakshi is given a choice to live in isolation or to be executed. This is because ardat-yakshi 
develop an addiction to the power and feel intense compulsion to meld. The addition only grows stronger with each meld, 
and so a life of monastic celibacy allows asari to leave in peace with a controllable desire. Those who are able to 
avoid isolation and execution, however, quickly become psychopathic in their intense lust for the destructive melding.

## Variant Traits
If you would like to play an ardat-yakshi, you can choose to replace the _Alignment_ and _Mind Meld_ traits with the following.
Additionally, you gain the _Dominate_ trait at 10th level.

__Alignment__. Ardat-yakshi often develop psychopathy. Ardat-yakshi are normally evil, but can also be neutral.

__Mind Break__. You can touch a willing creature and initiate a mind meld. If the target is unwilling, the meld does not continue. 
The creature must make a Charisma saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be 
rendered unconscious for 1d4 hours as your nervous system overwhelms theirs. Once you use this trait, you can't 
use it again until you finish a long rest.

__Dominate__. At 10th level, you learn the Dominate spell. Charisma is your spellcasting modifier for this spell and it 
does not count against your max number spells known or prepared. You can cast a 3rd-level version of this spell
once per long rest.
