The Collectors are an enigmatic race that live beyond the Omega 4 Relay, a mass relay within the same system as Omega, 
in the Terminus Systems. They are rarely seen in the Terminus itself, let alone Citadel space, and are generally regarded 
as a myth by Citadel citizens. Definite sightings of Collectors have been made on Omega every few centuries.

Collectors are former Protheans that have been completely subjugated by their Reaper masters. Their DNA shows signs of 
"extensive genetic rewrite" including three fewer chromosomes, reduced heterochromatin structure, and the elimination 
of superfluous "junk" sequences.

When the Reaper-killer known as Leviathan fought the Collectors, it severed their connection to Harbinger with a 
thrall device. Most Collector forces died as a result, but a few survived. Now, these rare individuals fight for the 
memory of their people, a proud race broken by the Reapers.

## Variant Traits
If you would like to play an awakened collector, you can choose to replace the _All-Seeing Eyes_, and _Psychometry_
traits with the following.

__Chitinous Exoskeleton__. While not wearing armor, you have +1 AC.

__Forewing Leap__. High and Long jump distances are tripled.

__Seeker Swarm__. As an action, you call 1d4 seeker swarms to a space you can see within 10m. The swarms remain for 
1 hour or until you dismiss them as a bonus action. The swarms are friendly to you and your companions for the duration.
The swarms have their own turn in the initiative order, which occurs immediately following your turn. 
                  
Once you use this feature, you must take a long rest before using it again.
