Former automatons build by the quarians to function as soldiers and laborers, geth are constructs that have 
unintentionally consciousness and sentience. Geth, meaning "servant of the people" in the quarian language of 
Khelish, are fundamentally different than other constructs and are designed with humanoid thought and emotion in mind.
Geth think, feel, and experience the world in a totally unique way.

## The Morning War
"Does this unit have a soul?" asked the geth. That question would change the relationship of quarians and geth forever. 
The quarians responded with an attempted termination of all geth. The newly sentient geth resisted the genocide of 
their masters in a war dubbed "the Morning War". As many geth were designed as tools of war, the quarians were quickly 
and easily defeated. Because the constructs were acting out of self-defense, when the enemy began retreating from their 
homeland of Rannoch, the geth did not pursue and allowed their masters to leave in peace.

## Incomprehensible Mind
Geth minds are quite anomalous. As they were designed to follow predetermined steps and commands, and with their minds 
powered from a centralized network, their way of thinking is essentially unique and different than the chaotic organic 
minds of humanoids. Their thoughts can be compared to a program or process which systematically follows steps to come 
to a conclusion, run many times in different ways until the geth comes to a consensus of the correct course of action. 
Geth do not experience emotion or desire - not in the same way a humanoid does, anyway. Additionally, due to their 
innate ability to network with other geth, geth see themselves as a unit of a larger and more complex whole and even 
the individual processes that make up a single geth as being equal constituents that contribute to that geth unit.

## Beyond the Veil
Geth primarily remain in the land of Rannoch, protected by the Perseus Veil: a mysterious cloud that spans around the 
borders of Rannoch. They live in peace, but some geth find themselves seeking knowledge of what is beyond their realm. 
The primary motivation of the geth who leave Rannoch is to acquire and compile information, though some geth pursue other 
quests.

## Geth Names
Geth have no use for names among themselves but will adopt names for the sake of interacting with other races. 
However, the geth do not often see themselves as individuals. Many geth use plural pronouns such as "us" and "we". 
As a result, the names geth take are normally synonyms or words for groups. Geth with individuality, especially those 
who have been separated from their kind for an extended time, do exist. Those geth still use words for names, though 
they give themselves a more personally fitting name.
