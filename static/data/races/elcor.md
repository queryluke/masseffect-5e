Elcor evolved on a high-gravity world, making them slow, but incredibly strong. Their large, heavy bodies are 
incapable of moving quickly, but they possess a rather imposing stature as well as thick, tough skin. They move using 
all four limbs to support and balance their massive bodies. Given their method of communication, they have highly-attuned 
olfactory senses. They also have at least three stomachs.

## Language of Smells and Sight
Elcor speech is heard by most species as a flat, ponderous monotone. Among themselves, scent, extremely 
slight body movements, and subvocalized infrasound convey shades of meaning that make a human smile seem as subtle 
as a fireworks display. Since their subtlety can lead to misunderstandings with other species, the elcor 
prefix all their dialog with non-elcor with an emotive statement to clarify their tone.

## Migratory Nature
Prehistoric elcor traveled across Dekuuna in large tribal groups. As their civilizations grew, they kept 
their migratory nature and established twin capitals on their homeworld, one for the wet season and one for the dry season.
However, their migration is limited to a single planet as most elcor find the confines of space travel very uncomfortable.

## Living Tanks
Because of their slow, conservative psyches, elcor are not suitable for making the spur-of-the-moment decisions 
necessary in combat situations. Instead, they rely on sophisticated VI combat systems. While easy targets, their durable 
hide allows them to shrug off most incoming fire. Elcor warriors use their broad shoulders as a mount for weaponry and 
their VI as a targeting mechanism. Some elcor are equipped with mass-accelerator cannons, the same weapons 
typically mounted on military vehicles.

## Elcor Names
Elcor do not have gender-binary names because their gender is discerned through smell. While the names appear singular,
they are made up of a much more complex set of sounds that only other elcor can hear.
