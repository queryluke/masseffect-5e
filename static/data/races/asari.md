Asari are a race of elegant, mono-gendered humanoids. The asari resemble female humans with blue or purple skin and a 
crest of rigid tentacles in place of hair. Despite their feminine appearance, asari have little use for gender or 
gender roles, though they often use female pronouns and gendered language. They possess a unique method of reproduction 
initiated by a "mind meld" which links the asari's nervous system with a partner-even one of a different race-to 
randomize genes to create asari offspring. Asari have an innate biotic ability and don't require a biotic implant to 
manipulate mass effect fields.

## Unmatched Patience
Because of their long lifespan, asari tend to have a "long view" not common in other races. When they encounter a new 
species or situation, the asari are more comfortable with an extended period of passive observation and study than immediate action.
They invite new species of advanced development to join the galactic community, knowing that their ideals and beliefs will 
inevitably influence the existing culture.

## Mothers of the Galaxy
Asari reproduction is very different from other forms of sexual reproduction. When a meld for reproduction is initiated, the 
asari accesses her partner's genes and subconsciously uses them as an algorithmic seed to remap genes into a unique set of DNA. 
The offspring resulting from such interspecies pairings are always asari as no DNA is taken from the partner. Instead, 
the asari uses the meld to explore her partner's genetic heritage and pass desirable traits on to any offspring and 
as a "map" to randomize the genes of the offspring.  

Asari believe that their offspring acquire the best qualities of the "father" from the melded genes. Therefore, they frown 
upon intraspecies conception, since genetic traits and cultural insight is gained from mating outside their species, so 
it's considered wasteful for asari to reproduce together. The results of such unions are occasionally referred to as 
"purebloods", a great insult among contemporary asari. A rare genetic defect known as Ardat-Yakshi, which makes 
asari destroy the partner's mind during melding, occurs much more frequently among the daughters of purebloods.

## Maiden, Matron, Matriarch
Asari pass through three climacteric life stages, marked by biochemical and physiological changes. The __Maiden__ stage 
begins at puberty and is marked by the drive to explore and experience. Most young asari are curious and restless, and 
it is not uncommon for many to try their hand at dancing in bars or working as mercenaries during this time. The __Matron__ 
stage of life begins around the age of 350, though it can be triggered earlier if the individual melds frequently. This 
period is marked by a desire to settle in one area and raise children. The __Matriarch__ stage begins around 700 years 
of age, or earlier if the individual melds rarely. Matriarchs become active in their community as sages and councilors, 
dispensing wisdom from centuries of experience. Their knowledge and guidance may be one reason why Matriarchs are rarely seen outside asari space.
However, each stage can be started whenever an asari feels that she has reached the correct level of maturity. 

## Asari Names
Asari are given a personal name by their parents and take the surname of their mothers, even if the child has 2 asari 
parents. Outside of asari communities, they normally do not use their surnames and prefer to introduce themselves with 
their personal name only. Matriarchs are addressed as "Matriarch" but other titles may be used for matriarchs in prestigious positions.
