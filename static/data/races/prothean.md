The Protheans are an ancient alien race which mysteriously vanished over 50,000 years ago. The Protheans arose from a 
single planet and developed an immense galaxy-wide empire encompassing many other spacefaring species. Not much is known 
about them, but many of their artifacts, ruins and technology have apparently survived the ages.

## Ancient Empire
After achieving spaceflight, the Protheans discovered the ruins of a previous spacefaring race, the inusannon, and from 
those ruins learned about mass effect physics and developed FTL technology. The Protheans would expand throughout the 
galaxy with the help of the mass relay network and make the Citadel their capital.

Early in their development, the Protheans encountered a hostile machine intelligence which threatened to overwhelm them. 
To defeat the machines, the Protheans decided to unite all of the galaxy's sentient organic life under their empire. 
The other organic races were free to resist, but those that tried were crushed, and none ever managed to best the Protheans' might.

## Reaper Invasion
The Protheans' belief that they could hold their own against machine intelligence was shattered with the arrival of the 
Reapers in approximately 48,000 BCE, who were far more advanced than the machines the Protheans had been battling. They 
were caught completely off-guard by the scale and rapidity of the assault. The Reapers entered the galaxy through the 
Citadel, instantly decapitating the Protheans' government and disrupting the mass relay network, isolating Prothean systems 
from one another. The Protheans' greatest strength, their unified empire, proved to be their downfall. 

## Stasis
In a desperate attempt to survive the Reaper invasion, the Protheans built massive, hidden stasis facilities that could
hold hundreds of thousands of stasis pods. Some facilities were found by Reaper agents or betrayed by indoctrinated Protheans.
Unfortunately, the facilities that remained hidden faced another challenge: a finite power source. The VI's left to control
these facilities began systematically cutting power to non-essential staff to conserve energy. 50,000 years later,
the number of active pods in each facility might be less than a dozen and without knowing the location of these hidden
bunkers, its impossible to know how many protheans have survived.

## All Eyes on You
As a prothean, you constantly attract the attention of other races. Your accent, mannerisms, figures of 
speech, and appearance all mark you as more alien than most aliens. Curious glances are directed your 
way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued 
by your ancient culture, to say nothing of everyday beings who are eager to hear stories of your origin.

## Avatars
Protheans that ascended to places of prominence in their society were designated as avatars, or exemplars, of a particular
virtue of their culture. Example virtues include benevolence, cleanliness, courage, dignity, frugality, honor, justice, 
mercy, order, perseverance, temperance, tranquility, truthfulness, vengeance. As one of the last remaining Protheans,
it is likely you are an avatar or, waking up to find you race all but extinct, you may self-appoint
your own virtue.

## Prothean Names
Interestingly, protheans name themselves, usually after an icon or mentor. Until they've chosen a name, they are 
called little one, child, or some other generic term.
