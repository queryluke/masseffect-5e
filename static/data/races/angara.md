The angara are warm-blooded mammals with relatively broad shoulders, narrow waists and skin colors of blue or mauve, 
sometimes shading into green or tan. They are the only known extant 
sapient race native to the Heleus Cluster of the Andromeda galaxy, and arose on the planet Havarl. Their unique
physiology is dependant on sunlight and allows them to produce natural bioelectrical fields. The angara as a people 
are very free with their emotions, demonstrative and "larger than life". If they love you they hug you, if
they hate you or if you make them mad, they punch you. 

## Creatures of the Sun
The angara electromagnetic radiation that is emitted from stars to survive. Lack of real or artificial sunlight causes 
them to "go dark", which weakens their immune systems and bio-energy significantly. Prolonged lack of sunlight can lead 
to a coma and then death. To supplement their sunlight intake or provide a light source when natural light is not 
readily available, the angara make use of powerful ultraviolet lamps that give them both heat and light.

## Family Oriented
While they have only one true mother and father, the angara share their parents with the community. Their 
families are very large, consisting of multiple mothers and many siblings and cousins. This close-knit society
makes angara very mistrustful of other races.

While the angara have many different religions, all share the same basic tenet: that when an angara dies, he or she is 
reincarnated and the reincarnated soul stays in the family, making their lineage stronger.

## Angara Names
Little is known about angaran names. But it is assumed that they do not use family names given the collective nature
of their families.
