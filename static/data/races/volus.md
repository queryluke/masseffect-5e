The volus are an associate race on the Citadel with their own embassy but are also a client race of the turians. They 
hail from Irune, which possesses a high-pressure greenhouse atmosphere able to support ammonia-based biochemistry. 

## Mysterious Biology
The volus are unable to survive unprotected in an atmosphere more suitable to humans and other carbon-based lifeforms, 
and as such require pressurized, protective suits capable of providing the proper atmosphere. Traditional nitrogen/oxygen 
air mixtures are poisonous to them, and in the low pressure atmospheres tolerable to most species, their flesh will actually 
split open.Unlike quarians, who can withstand brief periods outside their suit, volus choose never to take theirs off, 
especially in the presence of other races. Therefore, little is known about their physiology. Despite individuals distinctly 
sounding like males or females to human listeners, volus genders are a mystery as well. The volus themselves consider 
the question both intrusive and hilariously irrelevant. 

## Trade Warriors
The volus homeworld Irune is remarkable for having done away with warfare as an institution of the state. Instead,
volus romanticize a good bargain, haggling, and creative accounting. The fervent pursuit of economic wealth has 
made volus a race of aggressive traders and industrialists with a keen grasp of exchange and finance. 
Many of the galaxy's largest banks, holding corporations, and manufacturing cartels, such as the 
Elkoss Combine, are owned or managed by volus. They also regulate the Citadel's complex galactic economy and were
responsible for the Unified Banking Act, which established the "credit" as the standard currency of interstellar
trade.

Unlike most other races, volus are more comfortable with delayed gratification, especially when it comes to spending
their credits. Fugacious and materialistic purchases are rarely made. Instead, volus like to invest or save their money,
sometimes to a fault. In fact, the volus economy is largely bolstered by the large estates of wealthy volus who never
spent a cred.

## Council Seat
Despite their important contributions to the Citadel and galactic society, they have never been offered a seat on the 
Council. This is a source of anger for some volus, particularly the volus ambassador Din Korlack. Council races need 
to have provided some extraordinary service to the Citadel, such as the turians' military support during the 
Krogan Rebellions. Council races also need to provide fleets, resources, and economic aid in case of disaster, 
none of which the volus can currently supply. Therefore, the latest investment pursued by the volus is the construction
of well-armed dreadnoughts. 

## Volus Names
Volus have two names but no family names. According to volus sensibilities, one cannot own a person, so using a family 
name would essentially be laying claim to their offspring.
