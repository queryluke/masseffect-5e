A race of four-eyed bipeds with complexions of reddish-brown, greenish, yellow-greenish to yellow-brownish, light brown, or teal.
The Terminus Systems are infested with batarian pirate gangs and slaving 
rings, fueling the stereotype of the batarian thug. It should be noted that these criminals do not represent average 
citizens, who are forbidden to leave batarian space by their ubiquitous and paranoid government.

## Caste Through Credits
Batarians place an extremely high value on social caste and appearance, and overstepping one's place is frowned upon. 
Effective caste status can be bought on an ongoing basis like a subscription service, allowing the buyer to worm their 
way into the elite circles of batarian society given enough funds. Casting aspersions on the monetary worth of a 
social better is considered a serious insult. Batarians strongly believe that species with fewer than four eyes are 
less intelligent; they often gain the upper hand in interspecies arguments because other races find it difficult 
to know which eyes to focus on when speaking to them.

## The Hegemony
Their government, known as the Batarian Hegemony, is hostile to the Systems Alliance (human government), but beneath 
the notice of the powerful Council races. Humans receive the brunt of batarians' antagonism in the form of scams, slave raids, 
and terrorist attacks, incidents which the Hegemony covertly supports but is always quick to publicly distance itself from.
Given the batarian government's oppressive nature, it is speculated their 
supreme leadership is autocratic or totalitarian in nature, although the batarian homeworld of Khar'shan remains 
divided into various competing nation-states.
