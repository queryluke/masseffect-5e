The krogan are a species of large reptilian bipeds native to the planet Tuchanka, a world known for its harsh 
environments, scarce resources, and an overabundance of vicious predators. The krogan managed to not only survive on their 
unforgiving homeworld but actually thrived in the extreme conditions. Unfortunately, as krogan society became more 
technologically advanced, so did their weaponry. The end result is that they destroyed their homeworld in a nuclear war 
that reduced their race into primitive warring tribes.

## Biologically Impervious
Krogan biology reflects the conditions from where they come. The krogan are armored nearly head to toe in thick, chitinous 
plates which protect the krogan from the hazards of their homeland. They possess a hump which can store water and nutrients,
for the resources in Tuchanka are scare.

Curiously, the krogan also possess redundant organs; a second set of major organs in case of failure or injury. These 
traits make krogan exceptionally difficult to kill, but perhaps what makes krogan so dangerous is an adaptation known as "Blood Rage."

## Blood Rage
The blood rage is a legendary state of pure violence. When krogan enter a blood rage, they become nearly mindless 
killing machines, fighting through all injury and even death. Blood rage is due to an enormous flood of adrenaline and 
suppression of serotonin, which numbs the krogan to all pain. This state, combined with their plated hide, and redundant 
organs, allows the krogan to defeat creatures many times his size or power.

## Climb Atop the Dead
Krogan's value one thing above all else: strength. Krogan society is built upon this hierarchy, where the strong rule 
and the weak perish. They live in clans lead by a Warlord, and those clans constantly war for resources and for power. 
Even within these clans, treachery and distrust run rampant. Krogan often fight for dominance within these clans and 
will sacrifice their clan for personal gain without a second thought. Females are considered prizes and trophies and 
live in clans separate from the males.

## Rites and Rituals
The krogan culture is steeped in rituals. When a krogan is born, he suffers the Rite of Life. When wishes to join his 
first clan, he undergoes the Rite of Passage. If he wishes to be considered for breeding, he must take the Rite of Honor. 
When facing a new enemy, the Rite of Firsts is invoked.

A Krogan clan also has a shaman, who has endured the Rite of Insight. The rituals endured by a shaman are lengthy and 
torturous; most krogan who attempt the rite perish. Those who survive become the most respected member of their clan 
and are rarely challenged. The shaman is a clan's spiritual leader and guide and is believed to see into the spirit 
world itself.

## Krogan Names
Krogan names are fairly simple: a clan name followed by a given name, which is normally bestowed upon them by their father.
