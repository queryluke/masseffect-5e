Starting at {{ level }} level, You can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your biotic spells. When you cast a biotic spell that 
affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1+the spell's level. The chosen creatures 
automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half 
damage on a successful save.
