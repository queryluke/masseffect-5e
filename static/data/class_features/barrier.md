id: barrier
name: Barrier
---
As an action or bonus action, you create a biotic barrier around you that reduces incoming damage and fuels certain 
biotic abilities. Upon activating, you gain barrier ticks equal to the maximum shown on your class progression table.

Whenever you take damage while barrier is active, remove 1 barrier tick and reduce the damage by 1d8.

Barrier lasts 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or have no barrier ticks remaining. 
You can also end barrier at any time as a free action.

Once you have used barrier the maximum number of times for your Adept, Sentinel, or Vanguard level (whichever is highest),
you must finish a short rest before you can use it again. You may use barrier 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th,
5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.
