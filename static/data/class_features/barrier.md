As an action or bonus action, you create a biotic barrier around you that reduces incoming damage and fuels certain 
biotic abilities. You gain barrier ticks equal to the Barrier Ticks column shown on your class progression table. You total
barrier ticks cannot exceed the amount listed in the Barrier Ticks column of your class progression table, and any barrier
ticks gained in excess of this number are lost.

Whenever you would take damage while barrier is active, remove 1 barrier tick and reduce the damage by 1d8. Then, apply
any remaining damage it to other hit pools like tech armor, shields, temporary hit points, or hit points.

Barrier lasts 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or have no barrier ticks remaining. 
You can also end barrier at any time as a free action. When Barrier ends, you lose any remaining barrier ticks.

Once you have used barrier the maximum number of times for your combined Adept, Sentinel, and/or Vanguard levels,
you must finish a short rest before you can use it again. You may use barrier 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th,
5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.
