Your drone companion gains a variety of benefits while it is linked to you.

* The drone companion loses its Multiattack action, if it has one.
* The drone companion loses its vulnerability to lightning damage.
* The drone companion obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you
  determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its
  own. It has advantage on saving throws against any ability that tries to influence its actions.
* Your drone companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your companion uses your
  proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, a drone
  companion also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls.
* Your drone companion gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes proficient with all saving throws.
* For each level you gain after the 2nd, your drone companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points 1d8 (or 5) + its constitution modifier.
* Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your companion’s abilities also improve. Your companion
  can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As
  normal, your companion can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies
  otherwise.
* Your companion shares your alignment and has a personality trait and a flaw that you can roll for or select from the
  tables below. Your companion shares your ideal, and its bond is always, “The Engineer who created me is a beloved
  companion for whom I would gladly give my life.”
