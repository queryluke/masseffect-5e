You have learned to regain some of your biotic energy by meditating and calming your mind. Once per day when you finish
a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal
to or less than a third of your vanguard level (minimum 1), and none of the slots can be 3rd level or higher.

For example, if you’re a 10th-level vanguard, you can recover up to 4 levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either
two 2nd-level spell slots, one 2nd-level and two 1st-level spell slots, or four first-level spell slots.
