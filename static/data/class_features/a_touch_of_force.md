At {{ level }} level, you gain the ability to augment your weapons with your barrier. As a bonus action, you can expend
up to 3 barrier ticks to grant one weapon you're carrying a bonus to attack and damage rolls when you attack with it.
The bonus equals the number of barrier ticks you spent.

The additional damage is force damage and can detonate primed targets.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
