At {{ level }} level, you gain the ability to augment your weapons with your barrier. As a bonus action, you can expend
up to 3 barrier ticks to grant one weapon you're carrying a bonus to damage rolls equal to the number 
of barrier ticks spent. The additional damage is force damage and can detonate primed targets. This effect lasts
1 minute.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
