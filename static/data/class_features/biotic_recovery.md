You have learned to regain some of your biotic energy by meditating and calming your mind. Once per day when you finish
a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal
to or less than half your adept level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 3rd level or higher.

For example, if youâ€™re a 4th-level adept, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either
a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.
