You can spend 6 hours in a lab, or similar environment, using drugs to enhance the capabilities of standard medi-gel. It 
takes 2 hours to craft a single enhancement, but you can apply that benefit to any number of medi-gel cartridges. To craft 
another enhancement takes an additional 6 hours. Instead of using time to limit this feature, your GM can choose to allow 
you to add X divided by 2 (rounded up) enhancements, where X is your Intelligence modifier; then, you must finish a long 
rest before you can create new enhancements. Only one enhancement can be added to a medi-gel cartridge.

When creating an enhancement, choose from the list below:

Name | Enhancement
--- | ---
Stimulant | After using this medi-gel, you have advantage on the next saving throw or attack roll you make within 1 minute.
Opioid | Within 1 minute of using this medi-gel, if you would fall below 0 hit point but not outright die, you may fall to 1 hit point instead.
Steroid | After using this medi-gel, add +2 damage to all melee damage for 1 minute.
Minagen X3 | After using this medi-gel, gain +2 damage to all biotic spells and cantrips for 1 minute.
Videlicet | After using this medi-gel, gain +2 bonus to all ranged tech attacks for 1 minute.
Styptic | Increase the potency of the medi-gel by 1 level (maximum level is Superior)
