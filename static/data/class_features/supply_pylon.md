Call in a Supply Pylon to a location within 4m. At the start of your next turn, the pylon arrives. If any creature is 
standing in the targeted location, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, it has advantage on this saving throw. 
On a failed save, the creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone.

to gain a single resource listed below:

* Gain 2 grenades
* Gain 10 thermal clips
