By {{ level }} level, you can call in a Supply Pylon to a location within 4m. At the start of your next turn, the pylon arrives. If any creature is 
standing in the targeted location, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, it has advantage on this saving throw. 
On a failed save, the creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone.

Once the pylon has landed, friendly creatures (including you) within melee range can spend 1 action accessing the pylon 
to gain a single resource listed below:

* Gain 1 heavy heapon ammo charge 
* Gain 5 tech points
* Gain 5 levels worth of spell slots 
* Gain 2 enhanced medi-gel 
* Gain 2 grenades
* Gain 10 thermal clips

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.
