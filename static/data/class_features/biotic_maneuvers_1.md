At {{ level }} level, you learn three maneuvers that are fueled by your barrier ticks. You can use only one maneuver per attack. Some of your maneuvers 
require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver effects. The saving throw DC is 8 + your proficiency
bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier.

Disarming Attack | When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend one barrier tick to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it’s holding. You add the barrier tick die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.
Distracting Attack | When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend one barrier tick to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the barrier tick to the attack’s damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.
Feinting Attack | You can expend one barrier tick and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 2m of you as your target. You have advantage on your next melee attack roll against that creature. If that attack hits, add the barrier tick to the attack’s damage roll.
Goading Attack | When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend one barrier tick to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the barrier tick to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.
Lift Attack | When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend one barrier tick to attempt to lift a Medium or smaller size creature or object. You add the barrier tick to the attack’s damage roll, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target is lifted.
Menacing Attack | When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend one barrier tick to attempt to frighten the target. You add the barrier tick to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
Pushing Attack | When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend one barrier tick to attempt to drive the target back. You add the barrier tick to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 8m away from you.
Riposte | When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one barrier tick to make a melee attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the barrier tick to the attack's damage roll.
Sweeping Attack | When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend one barrier tick to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 2m of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes force damage equal to the number you roll on your barrier tick.
Trip Attack | When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend one barrier tick to attempt to knock the target down. You add the barrier tick to the attack’s damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.
