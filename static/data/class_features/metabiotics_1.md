At {{ level }} level, you gain the ability to use the power stored in your barrier to twist your spells to suit your needs. 
You gain two of the following Metabiotic options of your choice.

Metabiotics can only be applied to spells of 1st level or higher.

Name | Enhancement
--- | --- 
Careful Spell | When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, you spend 1 barrier tick and choose a number of those creatures up to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.
Distant Spell | When you cast a spell that has a range of 2m or greater, you can spend 1 barrier tick to double the range of the spell. When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 barrier tick to make the range of the spell 10m.
Empowered Spell | When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 barrier tick to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls. You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metabiotic option during the casting of the spell.
Heightened Spell | When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 barrier ticks to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.
Quickened Spell | When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 barrier ticks to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.
Twinned Spell | When you cast a spell that doesn't have a range of self and is incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current level, you can spend a number of barrier ticks equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).
