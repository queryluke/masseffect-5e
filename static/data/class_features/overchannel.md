Beginning at {{ level }} level, you can increase the power of your simpler biotics. When you cast a biotic spell of 1st or 2nd level that deals damage, 
you can deal maximum damage with that spell.

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you 
take 2d12 psychic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again 
before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and 
immunity.
