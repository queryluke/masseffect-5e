### Ear for Deceit
At {{ level }} level, you develop a talent for picking out lies. Whenever you make a Wisdom (Insight) check to determine whether a creature is lying, treat a roll of 7 or lower on the d20 as an 8.

### Eye for Detail

Starting at {{ level }} level, you can use a bonus action to make a Wisdom (Perception) check to spot a hidden creature or object or to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check to uncover or decipher clues.

### Insightful Fighting
At {{ level }} level, you gain the ability to decipher an opponent's tactics and develop a counter to them. As a bonus action,
you can make a Wisdom (Insight) check against a creature you can see that isn't incapacitated, contested by the target's
Charisma (Deception) check. If you succeed, you can use your Sneak Attack against that target even if you don't have
advantage on the attack roll, but not if you have disadvantage on it.

This benefit lasts for 1 minute or until you successfully use this feature against a different target.
