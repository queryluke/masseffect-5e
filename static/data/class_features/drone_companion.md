At {{ level }} level, you've learned to construct a drone companion. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 5000 credits worth of materials, 
you augment one of your drone's VI into a rudimentary AI, then create a synthetic body, transferring the AI into the body. 
Choose one of the following drones: assault, combat, defense, recon, rocket.

If your drone companion is ever slain, 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 2500 credits worth of materials, can create 
a new body and replicate the AI from a backup.

You can still summon a temporary drone using your tech points.
