Starting at {{ level }} level, if an ally uses a power that primes an enemy within 10m, you may use your reaction to detonate the primed enemy with a
quick tech burst that cannot miss.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any
expended uses when you finish a long rest.
