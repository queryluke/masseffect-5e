Starting at {{ level }} level, whenever a creature within 20m that you can see makes a weapon attack or casts a spell, you can use your reaction to
cast charge, targeting that creature. Resolve any effects caused by charge before the creature takes its action. The creature
may choose to make a different action this turn.
