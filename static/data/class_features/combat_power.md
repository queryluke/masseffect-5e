At {{ level }} level, you know one combat power of your choice from the infiltrator spell list. You learn additional
combat powers of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Combat Powers column of the Infiltrator table.

Instead of learning a new combat power, you may instead learn the advanced version of a combat power you already know.
