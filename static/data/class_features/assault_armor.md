Starting at {{ level }} level, your Tech Armor is rigged for keeping the action on you. When
you activate tech armor, you project a distracting holographic image (your choice) and each hostile creature within 20m
that can see you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + spellcasting modifier). On a failure,
a creature is compelled to attack you while your Tech Armor is active. A creature that is compelled to attack you always 
targets you when it makes a weapon or spell attack.

Each time a creature that is compelled to attack you takes damage from a source other than you, it makes a new Wisdom saving 
throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature is no longer compelled to attack you and is immune to
Assault Armor for the next 24 hours.

Synthetic creatures have advantage on the Wisdom saving throw.
