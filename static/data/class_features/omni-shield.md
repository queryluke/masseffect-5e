Starting at the {{ level }} level, you've mastered the omni-shield. As a bonus action, create a large kinetic shield out 
of your omni-tool that lasts one minute. You can end Omni-shield at any point as a free action.

While Omni-Shield is deployed, you gain the following:

* If wielding a single-handed ranged or melee weapon, gain +2 AC and a +2 bonus to Dexterity saving throws.
* If a creature within 2m of you is attacked, you may use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that attack.
* As an attack action, you may make a melee attack roll. On a hit, deal 1d12 bludgeoning damage. You may shove a
hit creature backward 2m.
