When you reach {{ level }} level, you can program your omni-tool to transform omni-gel into grenades. Choose two grenades from the grenade
list. As an action, you can spend 1 omni-gel to create and use a grenade of that type. The Mark of the grenade you create
is equal to your soldier level divided by 3 (rounded down).

You can spend 8 hours of programming to exchange a selected grenade with a different one.
