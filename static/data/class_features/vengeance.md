Starting at {{ level }} level, you can overcome grievous injuries. When you would make a death
saving throw, you can instead spring back to your feet with a burst of adrenaline. You immediately stand up (if you so
choose), and you regain hit points equal to half your hit point maximum. Then, you may draw any weapon you are carrying,
choose a target a creature within that weapon's normal range, and make 2 attacks with the weapon.

If the target creature is the same one that reduced you to 0 or fewer hit points, you have advantage on both attack rolls.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
