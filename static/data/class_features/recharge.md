Beginning at {{ level }} level, you've created a small reserve battery for your omni-tool, allowing you to regain some spent
tech points. Once per long rest, you can spend 1 minute cycling the power of your omni-tool gaining tech points equal to 
1d4 + your intelligence modifier. Your total tech points cannot exceed the tech points column for your engineer level
(as indicated on the engineer progression table).
