At the {{ level }} level, your aim with a sniper rifle becomes deadly. As a bonus action on your turn, you can overclock 
your targeting system to take careful aim at a creature you can see that is within range of a sniper rifle you're wielding.
Your ranged attacks with the sniper rifle gain two benefits against the target:

* The attacks ignore half and three-quarters cover.
* On a hit, the weapon deals additional damage to the target equal to 2 + half your infiltrator level.

This effect lasts 1 minute or until you use Steady Aim on a different target.

You can use this feature three times. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.
