Starting at {{ level }} level, you're able to optimize a basic tech spell. Choose one of the following
tech powers: Cryo Blast, Incinerate, or Overload. You always have this spell prepared. You may cast a 1 tech point version
of this spell without expending any tech points. If you cast the power at a high level, you must spend all tech points as normal.

You can prepare the advanced version of the selected spell at the cost of 1 prepared spell.

You can cast more potent version of this spell at higher levels. A 2 tech point version at 7th,
3 tech point version at 11th, and 4 tech point version at 15th.

If you wish to apply this feature to a spell you've already learned, you may choose to learn or advance a different tech
power instead.
