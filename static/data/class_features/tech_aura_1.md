In addition to the standard defensive VI, you've augmented your Tech Armor to run different VI packages. When you activate
tech armor, you can choose to run a different VI package instead. When you activate an alternate package, you
do not gain hit points, instead, you and any friendly creature within 10m of you gain
the effect of the package for 1 hour. You may only have one tech armor active at once.
