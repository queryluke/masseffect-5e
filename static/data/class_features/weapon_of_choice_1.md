name: Weapon of Choice
---
By {{ level }} level, you have undergone extensive training with a single weapon type. Choose a weapon type which becomes your Weapon of Choice. 
When you are holding your Weapon of Choice you gain a set of abilities that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice. 
You may spend 1 month of intensive training to exchange your Weapon of Choice with another weapon type.

__Superiority Dice__: You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. 
You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest. 

You can expend superiority dice to gain a number of different benefits:

* When you make a weapon attack against a creature with your Weapon of Choice, you can expend one superiority die to add 
it to the attack roll. You can use this ability before or after making the attack roll, but before any of the effects of 
the attack are applied.
* When you damage a creature with a weapon attack from your Weapon of Choice, you can expend one superiority die to add 
it to the damage roll. You can use this ability after rolling damage. If the attack causes the target to make a Constitution 
saving throw to maintain concentration, it has disadvantage on that save.
* When you are hit by a melee attack, if you are currently holding your Weapon of Choice, you can expend one superiority 
die as a reaction, adding the number rolled to your AC. If the attack still hits, you take half damage from it.
