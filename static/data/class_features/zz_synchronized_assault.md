You may use a reaction to sync the targeting computers of all your allies who are not incapacitated. You target an enemy, painting them with an infrared beam that lets all of your affected allies (and yourself) make an attack roll on that target using their weapon during your turn. If your affected ally has already taken their turn, they may still make an attack on the designated enemy, and if they have not yet taken their turn, they make the attack with advantage.

Once you use Synchronized Assault, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
