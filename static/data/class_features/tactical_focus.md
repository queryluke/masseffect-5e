At {{ level }} level, your tactical acumen and predictive VI algorithms allow you to provide direction to your
allies that can tilt a battle in your favor.

As a bonus action, you can select an area within 30m on the ground that measures 6m on each side. This area is your tactical focus.
It remains your tactical focus until you use this ability again or you become <condition id="incapacitated"/>.

When you select an area as your tactical focus, you choose one of your tactics to apply to that area. You gain three
tactics at 3rd level. You gain an additional tactic at 7th and 14th level. Each time you complete a long rest, you can
swap one of your tactics for a different one.

#### Tactics

__Advance__.
Update your allies' HUDs and outline optimal routes to your tactical focus. If an ally spends all of its movement
moving towards your tactical focus, it doubles its movement, ignores difficult terrain, and does not provoke attacks of
opportunity.

__Analysis__.
Focus all of your attention on the movements and capabilities of a single enemy. When you choose this tactic, you
additionally choose a single hostile creature within your tactical focus. Beginning when you set your tactical focus
and at the beginning of each of your subsequent turns, the DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or
inferior in regard to one of the following characteristics of your choice: One ability score (Strength, Dexterity,
Constitution, Intelligence, Charisma, or Wisdom), Armor Class, or Current hit points

__Clear the area__.
Pick out weak spots on your targets that force them out of your tactical focus. If an ally hit s a creature in your
tactical focus with a weapon attack, the ally can move that creature 2m.

__Heads up__.
If an allied creature in your tactical focus must make a Dexterity saving throw it has advantage on that saving throw.

__Pin down__.
When a hostile creature attempts to move out of your tactical focus, two target creatures of your choice can use
a reaction to make an attack of opportunity on the target. If both attacks are successful, the creature's movement becomes
0, it falls prone and remains in your tactical focus.

__Recon__.
Your VI focuses on the movement of dust and augments sound from your area of focus, reconstructing a perfect image on your
and your allies' HUD. Any creature within your tactical focus loses any benefits from being invisible, lightly obscured,
or heavily obscured.
