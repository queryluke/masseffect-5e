You've mastered the art of using small mass effect fields to slightly alter the outcome of other creature's actions. It 
might be a small burst under the muzzle of a gun to throw off the attacker's aim. Or negative field around a friendly 
creature as leaps away from a grenade, moving it out of damage's way.

When another creature you can see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to 
roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature's roll. You can do so after the 
creature rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.

You can use Bend Luck a number of times equal to half of your Adept level (minimum 1) before you finish a long rest.
