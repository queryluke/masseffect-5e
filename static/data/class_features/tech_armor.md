You've bolstered your armor with a powerful, defense-oriented AI. As a bonus action or as a reaction to taking damage,
activate your Tech Armor.

When activated, tech armor creates a new kinetic barrier with additional hit points equal to the sum of your sentinel level
and spellcasting modifier, multiplied by 2. When you have tech armor hit points and take damage, the tech armor hit points 
are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your shields and/or normal hit points. Tech armor lasts 1 minute 
or until it has 0 hit points remaining.

While tech armor is active, you can use your action to overload it. Each creature within 4m must make a Constitution 
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes force damage equal to the remaining hit points of your tech armor, 
or half as much on a successful one.

You can use Tech Armor twice between long rests.
