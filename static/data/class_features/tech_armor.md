You've bolstered your armor with a powerful, defense-oriented AI. As a bonus action or as a reaction to taking damage,
activate your Tech Armor.

When activated, tech armor creates a new kinetic barrier that has additional hit points. Add your Sentinel level to your
spellcasting modifier, then multiply the sum by 3. The result is the number of additional hit points provided by your
tech armor. Whenever you take damage, the tech armor takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces tech
armor to 0 hit points, remaining damage is done to your then shields (if any), then your hit points.

Tech armor lasts 1 minute or until it is reduced to 0 hit points. Alternatively, You can use your action to overload your
Tech Armor. Each creature within 4m must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes force
damage equal to the remaining hit points of your tech armor, or half as much on a successful one.

You can use Tech Armor twice between long rests.
