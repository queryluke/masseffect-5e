Learn the charge cantrip. If you have already learned it, you may learn a new cantrip instead.

The distance of charge is now 20m. When you use your action to cast charge, you may use a bonus action to shove or make one
weapon attack against the target. You gain +5 to the attack’s damage roll or shove the target 6m. To shove a target this
way, it must be no more than one size larger than you.
