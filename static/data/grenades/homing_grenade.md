Target a creature you can see within 10m. The target creature takes 1d6 thunder damage. Each other creature
within 2m of the target must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d6 thunder damage
or half as much on a successful one.

__At higher marks__: When you use this grenade at Mark II or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each mark above the first.
