Target an area within 10m. At the beginning of your next turn, creatures within 4m of the target must make
a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 thunder damage or half as much damage on a
successful one.

With a sticky grenade, you may choose to make a melee weapon attack on a target creature within 2m instead or a ranged
weapon attack on a target creature within 10m instead. Add your Dexterity modifier to the attack. Do not add your
proficiency bonus to the attack unless you have the Grenadier feat. On a hit, the grenade hits and sticks to the target,
and when it explodes, the target automatically fails its saving throw. On a miss, the grenade lands in the creature's square.

__At higher marks__: When you use this grenade at Mark II or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each mark above the first.
