Launch a recon mine to a location of your choice within 10m. It first sticks to the target location then
scans enemies within a 10m cone, relaying tactical weak points about the enemy's armor and location. After your turn ends,
any hostile that walks through the scanning cone loses 1 AC. Each creature can only be affected by this debuff once.

You may spend another action to detonate the mine. Each creature within 2m must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw.
On a failed save, a creature takes 2d4 thunder damage, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Creatures need to pass a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the mine.

To disarm the mine, a creature must pass a DC 13 Intelligence (Electronics) check. Failing the hacking check causes
the mine to explode. The creature that made the hacking check has disadvantage on its saving throw.

A successful ranged attack on the mine (AC 10) will cause it to explode. Each creature within 2m of the mine, takes 2d4 thunder damage.
