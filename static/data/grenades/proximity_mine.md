Place a proximity mine within 2m. The first creature, besides yourself, that comes within 2m of the mine
takes 1d8 thunder damage.

Creatures need to pass a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the mine.

To disarm the mine, a creature must pass a DC 13 Intelligence (Electronics) check. Failing the check causes
the mine to explode. The creature that made the hacking check has disadvantage on its saving throw.

A successful ranged attack on the mine (AC 10) will cause it to explode. Each creature within 2m of the mine takes 1d8 thunder damage.

__At higher marks__: When you use this mine at Mark II or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each mark above the first.
