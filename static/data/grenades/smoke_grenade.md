Target an area within 10m. A cloud of thick smoke erupts out in a 4m radius from the target location. The
cloud's area is heavily obscured. The cloud persists for 30 seconds. A moderate wind (11 to 20 miles per hour) can
disperse the smoke after 1 round, and a strong wind (21 or more miles per hour) can do so immediately.

__At higher marks__: When you use this grenade at Mark II or higher, the radius increases by 2m for each mark above the first.
