This suite of programs contains a subset holographic displays. A full suite has 20 displays. A used program is usually
missing 1d20 − 1 displays.

The creator of this program, a human hacker known as Gahri Gi'gax, wrote a randomization algorithm into its use. You can use
an action to activate a display at random from the program, spawning a holographic image within 12m of you.

The image of one or more creatures forms over the targeted area and remains until dispelled. The holographic creature
appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature except that it can do no harm. While
you are within 50m of the hologram and can see it, you can use an action to move it anywhere within 12m of the initial
location. Any physical interaction with the hologram reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it.
Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as a hologram with a successful DC 15
Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.

The hologram lasts 1 hour or until you cancel the display. At which point, the display removes itself from the suite.
Once you have used all of the displays, the programs deletes itself from your omni-tool.
