_Can only be used by humans_

This is an experimental, Cerberus-funded VI was created in the pursuit of a perfect AI that will put the protection of
humanity first and foremost. While it never achieved true AI status, this VI is highly advanced and single-mindedly
devoted to protecting & enabling humanity.

When you activate this program, designate one ranged weapon to install Terra Angelis onto. This weapon now has +3 to
attack and damage rolls. The first time you attack with this weapon on each of your turns, you can choose to transfer
some or all of the weapon's bonus to your AC, instead of using the bonus on any of your attacks for that turn
(i.e., add +2 to AC and +1 to attack/damage rolls). The adjusted bonuses remain until the start of your next turn,
although you must be wielding the weapon to gain the benefits.
