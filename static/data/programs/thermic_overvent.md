You can use an action to spend 1 omni-gel and overheat every heat-generating element within your omni-tool, overriding
safety protocols and using the omni-gel as propellant. You create three fire rays from your outstretched hand, each
with a range of 240m. You can hurl them at one target or several. Make a ranged spell attack for each ray. On a hit,
the target takes 2d6 fire damage. When you make the attacks, make them with a modifier of +5 to the attack roll. The
omni-tool then needs time to compensate and repair itself, rendering this program inoperative until the end of a long rest.

__Unstable__: When you acquire this program, it can be used 1d6 times before the code becomes too unstable to use.
