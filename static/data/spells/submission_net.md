Shoot a swarm of miniature pylons to a target location within 30m. Each creature within a 4m cylinder of the target
location must make a Dexterity saving throw. Any creature that fails the saving throw is trapped in an electrified net,
becoming <condition id="restrained"/> and cannot cast tech spells.

Until the spell ends, the area is considered difficult terrain. A creature that enters the cylinder for the first time
on its turn or ends its turn there must also make the Dexterity saving throw.

A creature restrained by submission net may use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save
DC to escape the net. On each attempt, the creature takes 1d6 lightning damage as it struggles against the net. On a
success, the creature is no longer restrained.

__At Higher Levels__: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, increase the size of the
net by 2m for each spell slot about the 2nd.
