Scan an 8m cube within range. Until the end of your next turn, any creature in the area when the spell is cast is
highlighted on all friendly creatures HUDs if it fails a Dexterity saving throw.

Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected
creature or object can't benefit from being invisible.
