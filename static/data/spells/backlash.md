Generate a frontal biotic aegis barrier with 15 hit points. If a creature you can see hits you with an attack while the
aegis is active, including the triggering attack, split the damage equally between yourself and the aegis. If the attack
is a ranged weapon attack from a non-heavy weapon, the portion of the damage that would be dealt to you is dealt to the
attacking creature instead.

If the damage is an odd number, you may choose where the extra 1 damage is dealt.

If damage that would be dealt to the aegis is greater than its remaining hit points, deal any remaining damage to yourself.

When the aegis drops to 0 hit points the spell ends.

__At Higher Levels__: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the aegis's hit points increase
by 10 for each slot level above the 2nd.
