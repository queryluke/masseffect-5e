Your Spellcasting Ability determines how far you can jump.

__Long Jump__. When you make a long jump, you cover a number of meters up to your Spellcasting Ability score. If jumping
over an obstacle, subtract 1 meter of distance per 2 meters of the obstacle's height.

__High Jump__. When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of meters equal to 2 + your Spellcasting Modifier.
