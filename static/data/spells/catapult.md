  description: When you cast Salvo, you may target a number of objects equal to or
    less than your spellcasting modifier. The combined weight of the objects cannot
    exceed the maximum weight limit of the spell (10 kilos at 1st level, 12 kilos
    at 2nd level, etc).
- name: Counterstrike
  description: You may cast catapult as a reaction when you see a creature within
    30m of you casting a spell or making a weapon attack. If the object would strike
    a creature casting a spell, the creature automatically fails its Dexterity saving
    throw and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or the spell fails and has
    no effect (DC 10 or half the damage done by catapult, whichever is higher). If
    object would strike a creature making a weapon attack, you impose disadvantage
    on the attack roll whether or not the creature fails its Dexterity saving throw.

Choose one object weighing 1 to 10 kilos (about 2 to 20 lbs.) within range that isn't being worn or carried. The object
flies in a straight line up to 30m in a direction you choose before falling to the ground, stopping early if it impacts
against a solid surface. If the object would strike a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a
failed save, the object strikes the creature and stops moving. When the object strikes something, the object and what it
strikes each take 3d10 bludgeoning damage.

__At Higher Levels__: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the maximum weight of objects
that you can target with this spell increases by 5 kilos (10lbs), and the damage increases by 2d10, for each slot level
above 1st.
