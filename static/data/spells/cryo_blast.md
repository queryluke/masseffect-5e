  description: Transform the attack into a deadly lance. Make a ranged spell attack on a target within range. On a hit,
    the target takes 1d8 cold and 2d4 piercing damage for a 1st-level version and an additional 1d8 and 2d4 for each
    slot level above the 1st.
- name: Frigid Air
  description: The blast creates a pocket of frigid air that lasts until the end of your next turn. Each creature that
    enters the frozen space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there becomes primed cold until the end of
    its next turn and must succeed a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 cold damage.

Fire a mass of supercooled, subatomic particles. The particles explode in a 2m-radius sphere centered on a point within
range. Each creature within the sphere has its movement reduced by 4m until the start of your next turn and must make a
Strength saving throw. On a failed saved, a creature becomes <condition id="frozen"/> until the start of your next turn.
A target with at least 1 shield point has advantage on this saving throw.

If the blast strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it
freezes the liquid to a depth of 15 centimeters over an area 10m. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were
swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength
check against your spell save DC to break free.

__At Higher Levels__: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the blast increases
by 2m for each slot level above 1st.
