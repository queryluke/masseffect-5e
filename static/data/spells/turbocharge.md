Activate a subroutine that temporarily vents weapon heat through your armor to improve thermal clip efficiency and
weapon damage. Until the end of your turn, the weapon you're currently holding gains Burst Fire, the heat cost for making
a Burst Fire attack is reduced by 1 heat, and you may make a Burst Fire attack as an Attack action.

You must finish a short or long rest before using Turbocharge again.
