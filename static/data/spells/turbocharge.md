Activate a subroutine that temporarily vents weapon heat through your armor to improve thermal clip efficiency and
weapon damage. Until the end of your turn, the weapon your currently holding gains Burst Fire, the heat expense from
using Burst Fire is 2, and you may use Burst Fire an Attack action.

You must finish a short or long rest before using Turbocharge again.
