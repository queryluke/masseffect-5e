Increase the mass of your fist and strike at a target. Make a melee spell attack on a target creature or object within range.
On a hit, deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage. If you have an active barrier, regain 2 barrier ticks and reset the duration of 
your barrier to 1 minute.

This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), 17th level (4d8).
