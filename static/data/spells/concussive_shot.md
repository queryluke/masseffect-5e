Load a specialized thermal clip into the weapon you are currently holding. Until you reload, any successful ranged
attacks deal an additional 1d8 bludgeoning damage and medium-sized or smaller creatures must pass a Strength saving
throw (DC 8 + proficiency bonus + DEX modifier) or are knocked <condition id="prone"/>.

The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach the 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8) and 17th level (4d8).

You have 3 charges of Concussive Shot. You regain all of your charges when you finish a long rest.
