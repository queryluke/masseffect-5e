Construct a sentry turret in an unoccupied space within 2m. You have complete control over the turret. Any hacking
attempts on the turret are rolled against your Intelligence, not the turret's.

The turret has its own turn in the initiative order, which occurs immediately following your turn.

The turret lasts until its hit points become 0 or lower or until you use a bonus action to destroy it.

__At Higher Levels__: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the turret deals an additional
1d6 piercing and 1d6 radiant damage with its mass accelerator machinegun and gains 10 additional hit points for
each spell slot above the 3rd.
