As a bonus action or as a reaction to taking damage, you reinforce your armor with razor-sharp blades that damage 
nearby enemies. Until the spell ends, you AC increases by 2 but you are unable to Dodge and have disadvantage on Dexterity 
saving throws. You can use a bonus action to deactivate blade armor.

While blade armor is active, it is considered a melee weapon that deals 1d6 piercing damage. If a creature is grappled by
you, you have advantage on attack rolls made with blade armor against the grappled creature. 

You have advantage on your Strength (Athletics) to grapple and deal 1d6 piercing damage when you grapple the target. 
A creature that is grappled by you while blade armor is active takes 1d6 piercing damage each time it attempts to 
escape from the grapple.

You must finish a long rest before you can use this ability again.

Blade armor's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), 17th level (4d6).
