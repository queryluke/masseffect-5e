Spend 5 shield points as you overload your shield capacitors causing a loud, painfully intense kinetic wave to
erupt in a 4m-radius sphere centered on you. Each creature within the sphere becomes <condition id="deafened"/> and must
make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + proficiency bonus). On a failed save, a creature takes
2d8 psychic damage and is <condition id="stunned"/> until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes
half as much psychic damage.

Synthetic creatures have advantage on this saving throw.

The first time you use siege pulse, your armor suffers no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you
finish a short rest, your shields run the risk of overloading. Roll a d20, immediately after you cast it. On a roll of 5 or
lower, your shields overload. You lose all shield points take 2d12 lightning damage. You cannot gain shield points unless
you equip new armor or repair your armor. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a short rest, the target
DC increases by 5 (10 on the third cast, 15 on the fourth, etc).

This feature's psychic damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (3d8), 11th level (4d8), 17th level (5d8).
