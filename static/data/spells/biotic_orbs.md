Summon 3 biotic orbs that float around you, fueling your biotic energies. As an action, you may expend an orb and make a
ranged spell attack on a creature within 40m. On a hit, deal force damage equal to 2d10 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

As an action, you may expend 3 orbs to cast a spell using your highest available spell slot. Casting a spell in this way
does not consume the spell slot.

__At Higher Levels__: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the number of orbs increases by
2 for each slot level above the 2nd.
