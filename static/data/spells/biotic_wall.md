With an immense positive charge, create an invisible mass effect field that acts as a wall at a point you choose within
range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free
floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 4m,
or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 2m by 2m panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any
form, the wall is 1 cm thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the
creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).

Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage.
