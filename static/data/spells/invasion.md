Unleash a VI-controlled machine swarm at a creature or object within range. Two swarms then spread from that target 
to as many as two other targets, each of which must be within 6m of the first target. A target can be a creature or an 
object and can be targeted by only one of the swarms.

A target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d8 psychic and has disadvantage on 
attack rolls until the spell ends. A creature affected by the swarm can use its action to make a Constitution check 
against your spell save DC. On a success, it breaks free of the swarm.

__At Higher Levels__: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 
and the range the swarms can spread increases by 2m for each slot level above 1st.
