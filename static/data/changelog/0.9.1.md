# v0.9.1

For those unfamiliar with software development, any sub-1.0 version is generally considered "in beta", which basically means
an incomplete product. v0.9.0 brings us to the cusp of moving beyond beta and into a true production release. But making
the next step will take time and lots of playtesting. First, it is very unlikely there will be anymore major overhauls
with the system. At this point, everything is mostly in place and moving from v0.9.0 to v1.0.0 encompass a lot of minor
tweaks based on playtesting and additional items like vehicles, spells, and omin-tool programs to round out the system.
