# Hiatus

I wanted to let everyone know that with this release, I'm going to take an extended hiatus from development. I'm currently
in the process of moving and starting a new job in a few weeks. Then the holidays will follow shortly after. I'm going to
use this time to think about where I want this system to go and what are the next steps I'd like to take.

If anyone is creating pre-written missions or new tabletop assets, I will continue to link those assets on the site. But
I won't be doing any content tweaking or editing. I've even got a few missions of my own I'd like to get on the site at some point.

The community is still growing, and I encourage you all to keep involved via the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect5e/),
share your ideas, and ask questions. With the release of the new PDF, I hope I've made it as easy as possible for other
designers and GMs to tweak or all-out rewrite whatever rules they want and make the game their own.

# v1.2.0

- Removed the v0.8.4 classes. You can find them in [previous versions of the pdf](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1eDfgpG3JplKUjrIdySJKmyC4qxTi2MUT).

## Highlights

- [New PDF](/print/pdf) created with Homebrewery. 

## Rules
- Removed Unshackled AI from random height/weight table. Replaced Geth random values with unshackled AI.
- Clarified Set Bonuses in the Armor section
- Fixed targeting description in the rules. Incorrectly said targeting was a free action.
- Fixed weapon mods description in rules section. Incorrectly said melee weapons could not have mods.
- Changed medi-gel resupply cost to "varies" as the cost varies based on the medi-gel type.
- Added _Variant: Venting_ to the Thermal Clips section of the rules.
- Fixed the error in the Charisma section of Using Ability Scores which referenced "wisdom" 

## Classes

- __Barrier__. Number of uses previously said it was based on your highest Adept, Sentinel, or Vanguard level. Changed 
to your combined levels of those classes.

### Engineer
- __Engineer's Efficiency__: Reduces the scaling increase of the spell to a 2TP version at 11th level. EE was intended 
to be a filler spell for engineers, but scaling to a free 2nd-, 3rd-, 4th-level spell essentially replaced the need for 
weapons and was almost always the best action for the engineer to take.
- __Medic, Medi-gel Enhancements__: Clarify feature text, "Within 1 minute of using this medi-gel, the next time you 
take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points but doesn't kill you outright, you are reduced to 1 hit point instead."

### Sentinel
- __Heavy Barrier__: reduce from 3d8 to 2d8

### Soldier
- __Tactical Reload__: Changed to "When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can use one of your attacks to 
reload a weapon your are wielding."
- __Indomitable__: Correctly provide 1, 2, and 3 uses at appropriate levels.

### Vanguard
- __Heavy Barrier__: reduce from 3d8 to 2d8

## Feats
- __Melee Specialist__ correctly highlighted as a new feat.
- __Grenadier__. Added a range of the grenade attack (10m/30m)
- __Hair Trigger__. Remove free action attack from Hair Trigger.

## Armor Sets
- __Maverick Boots__ incorrectly had a 19 or higher as a critical hit, the rest of the set had an 18.

## Spells
- __Tactical Scan__. _Telegraphed Attacks_ advancement only benefits the caster.

## Bestiary
- Fixed issue of some creatures with infrared vision showing a distance of "null" meters.
- __Assault Drone__:
  - Increase health from 3d6 to 5d6
- __Combat Drone__: 
  - Increase health from 3d6 to 6d6
  - Removed erroneous _petrified_ immunity.
- __Defense Drone__:
  - Increase health from 4d6 to 6d6
- __Disruption Drone__: 
  - Increase health from 2d6 to 4d6
  - Clarified Self destruct mechanic.
  - Increased explosion damage to 2d12.
- __Recon Drone__:
  - Increase health from 2d6 to 4d6
- __Rocket Drone__:
  - Increase health from 2d6 to 5d6
  - Increase damage to 2d8
  - Increase CR to 1/2
- __Repair Drone__:
  - Increase health from 2d6 to 5d6
