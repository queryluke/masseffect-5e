# v1.2.0

- Removed the v0.8.4 classes. With new work on tweaking classes for better balance, and future subclasses in the works, it
was too difficult to try and support these options. You can find them in [previous versions of the pdf](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1eDfgpG3JplKUjrIdySJKmyC4qxTi2MUT).

## Highlights

## Classes

### Engineer

- __Engineer's Efficiency__: Reduces the scaling increase of the spell to a 2TP version at 11th level. EE was intended 
to be a filler spell for engineers, but scaling to a free 2nd-, 3rd-, 4th-level spell essentially replaced the need for 
weapons and was almost always the best action for the engineer to take.

### Soldier

- __Tactical Reload__: Changed to "When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can use one of your attacks to 
reload a weapon your are wielding."
