# v0.9.2  

<br>

## Rules

### AC & Armor
I've clarified the Armor & AC table. Before Arms & Legs were in the same row, which indicated that the AC bonus was for wearing arm _AND_ leg armor.
However, the intent is that Arm and Leg armor provide their own AC bonus. 

Additionally, I clarified that wearing pieces from different armor sets still provides the AC from the armor, but you do not get any set bonuses.
In a future patch, I plan to expand this further and make the set bonuses based on the number of pieces you are wearing. 

## Classes
Multiclassing proficiency gains have been improved for the following classes:
- Engineer, Assualt Rifles and Medium Armor
- Infiltrator, Sniper Rifles and Melee Weapons
- Sentinel, Medium and Heavy Armor, and 1 weapon type from Assault Rifles, Melee, Shotguns, or SMGs
- Soldier, Medium and Heavy Armor, and 2 weapon types
- Vanguard, Medium Armor and Shotguns

### Soldier

## Races

Descriptions have been added to each race, largely sourced from [Races from the Relay](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-L7HA1pIhxcx3bVb8vqf) by [/u/thestray](https://www.reddit.com/user/thestray).

Race changes below have been made for 2 reasons:
- Balance, based on [Detect Balance: a 5e Homebrew Race Guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vq1kz6PRAbw5LHy6amH-bNb4OuB8DBXL1RsZROt03Sc/edit#gid=0) by Eleazzaar
- The pervasiveness of starting feats for each race diluted the uniqueness of each race.

- __Asari__
  - Removed _Skill Versatility_ replaced with _Natural Diplomat_
  - combined _Biotic Initiate_ and _Innate Biotics_ into a single trait
  - Added _Ardat-Yakshi_ as a variant

- __Batarian__
  - Removed feat options
  - Added Four Eyes 
  
- __Drell__
  - Removed feat options
  - Removed _Hallucinogen_ as it is primarily flavor with very little game impact
  - Removed _Darkvision_ as there is no indication that Drell can see in the dark
  - Replaced _Keen Senses_ with _Natural Hunter_ providing 2 skill proficiencies from a list
  - Added _Raw Agility_ allowing speed boosts 
  
- __Elcor__
  - Removed _Unstealthy_, given some technology they could be stealthy and quiet
  - Removed _Stability_, for balancing reasons. High AC already assists in their defensive capabilities
  - Changed _Thick Hide_, bonus is not restricted to not wearing armor. Use Con instead of Dex
  - Added _Shoulder Mounts_, explains how elcor use ranged weapons.
  
- __Geth__
  - Changed _Repair Matrix_, geth cannot be healed by medi-gel or spells that target organic creature. Instead they can spend
    hit die as an action. 
  
- __Hanar__
  - Completely reworked.
  
- __Humans__
  - Made humans in line with D&D 5th Edition. The variant human is available.
  
- __Krogan__
  - Adjusted ability score increases to +2 CON and +1 STR
  - Removed _Natural Armor_, replaced with _Toughness_. Wanted Krogans to be tough to kill, not tough to hit.
  - Replaced _Rage_ with _Blood Rage_, as it better represents their relentlessness.
  - Removed _Relentless_ as it is better reflected by _Blood Rage_
  - Added _Extremophile_ from Races from the Relay, as it better represents their ability to survive
  
- __Prothean__
  - _All eyes on you_ and _Avatar_ moved to the flavor/about section as they had little game impact.
  
- __Quarian__
  - Ability scores reduce to two +1's (DEX and INT). Additional scores are gained from the cybernetic enhancements
  - _Cybernetic Enhancement_ adds greater variety (thanks to Races from the Relay for the ideas).
  - _Hermetic suit_ now requires critical damage to be of puncture or slashing type to breach the suit.

- __Turian__
  - _Turian Toughness_ decreases to 1 extra HP per level, keeping in line Dwarven Toughness from 5th edition.
  
- __Unshackled AI__ are a variant race of [geth](/phb/races/geth).

## Spells
