# v0.9.2  

<br>

## Rules

### AC & Armor
I've clarified the Armor & AC table. Before Arms & Legs were in the same row, which indicated that the AC bonus was for wearing arm _AND_ leg armor.
However, the intent is that Arm and Leg armor provide their own AC bonus. 

Additionally, I clarified that wearing pieces from different armor sets still provides the AC from the armor, but you do not get any set bonuses.
In a future patch, I plan to expand this further and make the set bonuses based on the number of pieces you are wearing. 

## Classes
Multiclassing proficiency gains have been improved for the following classes:
- Engineer, Assualt Rifles and Medium Armor
- Infiltrator, Sniper Rifles and Melee Weapons
- Sentinel, Medium and Heavy Armor, and 1 weapon type from Assault Rifles, Melee, Shotguns, or SMGs
- Soldier, Medium and Heavy Armor, and 2 weapon types
- Vanguard, Medium Armor and Shotguns

### Soldier

## Races

Descriptions have been added to each race, largely sourced from [Races from the Relay](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-L7HA1pIhxcx3bVb8vqf) by [/u/thestray](https://www.reddit.com/user/thestray).

Race changes below have been made for 2 reasons:
- Balance, based on [Detect Balance: a 5e Homebrew Race Guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vq1kz6PRAbw5LHy6amH-bNb4OuB8DBXL1RsZROt03Sc/edit#gid=0) by Eleazzaar
- The pervasiveness of starting feats for each race diluted the uniqueness of each race.

  - combined _Biotic Initiate_ and _Innate Biotics_ into a single trait
  - Added _Ardat-Yakshi_ as a variant
