# v0.9.2  

<br>

## Rules

### AC & Armor
I've clarified the Armor & AC table. Before Arms & Legs were in the same row, which indicated that the AC bonus was for wearing arm _AND_ leg armor.
However, the intent is that Arm and Leg armor provide their own AC bonus. 

## Classes
Multiclassing proficiency gains have been improved for the following classes:
- Engineer, Assualt Rifles and Medium Armor
- Infiltrator, Sniper Rifles and Melee Weapons
- Sentinel, Medium and Heavy Armor, and 1 weapon type from Assault Rifles, Melee, Shotguns, or SMGs
- Soldier, Medium and Heavy Armor, and 2 weapon types
- Vanguard, Medium Armor and Shotguns

### Soldier

## Races

Descriptions have been added to each race, largely sourced from [Races from the Relay](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-L7HA1pIhxcx3bVb8vqf) by [/u/thestray](https://www.reddit.com/user/thestray).

Race changes below have been made for 2 reasons:
- Balance, based on [Detect Balance: a 5e Homebrew Race Guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vq1kz6PRAbw5LHy6amH-bNb4OuB8DBXL1RsZROt03Sc/edit#gid=0) by Eleazzaar
- The pervasiveness of starting feats for each race diluted the uniqueness of each race.

- __Asari__
  - Removed _Skill Versatility_ replaced with _Natural Diplomat_
  - Added _Ardat-Yakshi_ as a variant

- __Batarian__
  - Removed feat options
  - Added Four Eyes 

- __Turian__
  - _Turian Toughness_ decreases to 1 extra HP per level, keeping in line Dwarven Toughness from 5th edition.

## Spells
- __Hawk Missile Launcher__. Cooldown increased to once per short rest (instead of twice).

## Bestiary

- Blood Pack correctly labeled with "Blood Pack" faction

## Backgrounds
Some of the backgrounds were missing starting credits.
- Criminal now has starting credits (1,500)
- Scholar now has starting credits (2,000)

## Omni-tool Programs
- __Cognition booster__ _uncommon_ -> _rare_
- __Threat Assessment__ _uncommon_ -> _rare_
- __Trace Signal Jammer__ clarified advantage on saving throw against heavy weapons that require targeting

## Misc
- All class features now indicate at which level you receive them.
- Class features correctly appear on the class features tab.
- Navigation between classes & races has been added to the individual class/race pages
