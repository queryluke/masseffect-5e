# v0.9.2  

<br>

## Rules

### AC & Armor
I've clarified the Armor & AC table. Before Arms & Legs were in the same row, which indicated that the AC bonus was for wearing arm _AND_ leg armor.
However, the intent is that Arm and Leg armor provide their own AC bonus. 

## Classes

### Soldier
- Multiclassing as a solider now awards 2 additional weapon proficiencies rather than 1

## Races

- __Turian__
  - _Turian Toughness_ decreases to 1 extra HP per level, keeping in line Dwarven Toughness from 5th edition.

## Spells
- __Hawk Missile Launcher__. Cooldown increased to once per short rest (instead of twice).

## Bestiary

- Blood Pack correctly labeled with "Blood Pack" faction

## Backgrounds
Some of the backgrounds were missing starting credits.
- Criminal now has starting credits (1,500)
- Scholar now has starting credits (2,000)

## Omni-tool Programs
- __Cognition booster__ _uncommon_ -> _rare_
- __Threat Assessment__ _uncommon_ -> _rare_
- __Trace Signal Jammer__ clarified advantage on saving throw against heavy weapons that require targeting

## Misc
- All class features now indicate at which level you receive them.
- Class features correctly appear on the class features tab.
