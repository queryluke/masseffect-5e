# v1.0.0

## Note from Luke A.

(Placeholder for future of system)

## Rules

- Expanded the armor bonuses and limitations table to be more gradient and realistic. Before if you were wearing all
light armor and added heavy arms, the required STR jumped to 16.
- High Jump distance is divided by three instead of two (most things can't high jump 4 meters, ~12ft)
- Clarified that after your shield regeneration begins, it continues at the start of your turn until your shields are max
or you take damage.
- Weapon mods cannot be uninstalled from weapons. This was a hold-over from before there were tools and kits. Now, using weaponsmith's
workbench is the only way to _potentially_ salvage installed mods. The primary issue is that weapon mods are fairly cheap for their
gameplay value and players could easily buy the best mods and swap them between better weapons with ease. Without the ability to
remove a mod, if players want to customize a weapon, they need to buy or build a new weapon. If you'd prefer to use
a more flexible modding system, we recommend that you increase the cost of weapon mods 10 fold. 

## Classes
- __Barrier__: There was an infinite combination between biotic punch and barrier. With RAW, a player could cast biotic punch
repeatedly to gain any many barrier ticks as possible. Your total possible barrier ticks is now limited to the barrier ticks
column in the class progression table. This was always the intent but is now been explicitly stated.

### Engineer
- __Supply Pylon__: Clarified some of the text in supply pylon. First, the resources are selected when you summon it and you only have one
of each resource. Second, specified which grenades and their mark. Additionally, there is a cost of 5 omni-gel to recharge this ability. It was pointed out that players
could easily spent, say, a month calling the supply pylon a few times a day and sell the items within for infinite cash.

### Sentinel
- Reduced Tech Armor hit points to (Sentinel Lvl + Spellcasting Mod) * ~~3~~ _2_.
- __Guardian__
  - _Omni-shield_:
    - Removed _If wielding a single-handed ranged or melee weapon, gain +2 AC and a +2 bonus to Dexterity saving throws._ Replaced with +1 AC.
    - Added Fire and Cryo shield augmentation at higher levels.
  

### Soldier
- __Havoc__: Makeshift grenades increase in power at higher levels.

### Vanguard
- __Shock Trooper__
  - _A Touch of Force_: The bonus only applies to damage rolls. Fictionally, it didn't make sense for a biotic boost to affect
    the ability to attack with a weapon. Also, added a 1 minute length to the effect.

## Races

### Geth
- __Unshackled AI__, updated description to better distinguish that unshackled AI are a variant race rather than a subrace.

### Hanar
- Hover is not it's own movement speed, but a type of flying and hanar cannot fly. Instead, they have been given a
a new trait _contra-gravitic levitation_ which provides a walking speed but has a chance to malfunction.

### Prothean
- Added the Awakened Collector variant race

### Volus
- Added a deadlier version of the hermetic suit breach since volus are much more at risk to breaches.

### Vorcha
- Added an _Underground_ environment option for the _Adaptation_ trait

## Spells
Two new spells. As said above, I'd love to get some spell submissions from the community.
- Biotic Jump
- Invasion

## Bestiary
- Any creature that has barrier ticks, now has text that indicates it takes 1d8 reduced damage when hit.

## Weapons
All new weapons based on the Andromeda game. Like the armor sets, some weapons found only in the Andromeda galaxy have
an "Andromeda" flag. This means the weapon wouldn't be found in the Milky Way, but you can simply rename the weapon or 
agree that the weapon was made in the Milky Way and use it.

## Armor Sets
Armor sets have been largely overhauled to introduce a new mechanic: Armor Set Bonuses. The purpose of this change was
two-fold: first, to alleviate confusion about what bonuses you receive from wearing a single piece of armor from a set,
and, second, to make armor pieces more accessible at all stages of the game. It also allows for more mix-and-match potential
without requiring the player to have to create custom armor. This merely represents a sample of potential armor sets,
but the possibilities are endless.

### Full Armor that has become individual pieces with set bonuses
- Blood Dragon Armor
- Cerberus Ajax Armor
- Cerberus Assault Armor
- Cerberus Nightmare Armor
- Cerberus Shade Armor
- Cerberus Spirit Armor
- Collector Armor
- Colossus Armor
- Inferno Armor
- N7 Defender Armor
- N7 Armor
- Partisan Armor
- Reckoner-Knight Armor
- Terminus Assault Armor

### Andromeda Items

Some items are marked with an "Andromeda" flag. But this only means that the armors name and flavor text 
does not apply to Milky Way settings. We still encourage GMs to allow players to purchase these Andromeda armor, but,
above the table, decide on a different name and origin. Note that some armor from the Andromeda _game_ are not flagged.
This is because the armor could reasonably be available in the Milky Way. For Example, HyperGuardian armor was purchased
by the Andromeda Initiative and taken with them to the Andromeda Galaxy. But it was manufactured in the Milky Way by
Kassa Fabrication.

- Andromeda Elite Helmet
- Angaran Armor set
- Deep Space Explorer Armor set
- Heleus Armor set
- HyperGuardian Armor set
- Initiative Armor set
- Kett Armor set
- Maverick Armor set
- Pathfinder Armor set
- Remnant Armor
- Scavenger Armor

### New / Updated Body Armor

Additionally, some new body armor has been introduced as standard upgrades to stock armor. Names of these new armor
come from the list of Mass Effect 1 armor (though similarities stop there).

- Assassin Armor
- Crisis Armor
- Duelist Armor
- Freedom Armor
- Gladiator Armor
- Hoplite Armor
- Survivor Armor
- Liberator Armor
- Predator Armor
- Onyx Armor
- Skirmish Armor
- Titan Armor
- Ursa Armor

If you need the old armor pieces, you can find them in the [v0.9.2 Player's Manual](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hR63JVeS21uYYAnrV8PCCbsHV_jvKm8Y).

## Omni-Tools
Introduced a new concept of "Unstable" programs. These can be used more than once, but have a limited number or uses due to the
instability of the code. thermic_overvent.exe have been changed to an unstable program as an example.

## Misc
- Added a Random Height & Weight table from Rex the Pig
