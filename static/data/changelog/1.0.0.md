## Note from Luke A.

(Placeholder for future of system)

## Rules 

## Classes

### Soldier
- __Havoc__: Makeshift grenades increase in power at higher levels.

## Races

### Geth
- __Unshackled AI__, updated description to better distinguish that unshackled AI are a variant race rather than a subrace.

### Hanar
- Hover is not it's own movement speed, but a type of flying and hanar cannot fly. Instead, they have been given a
a new trait _contra-gravitic levitation_ which provides a walking speed but has a chance to malfunction.

### Volus
- Added a deadlier version of the hermetic suit breach since volus are much more at risk to breaches.

- Added an _Underground_ environment option for the _Adaptation_ trait

## Armor Sets
Armor sets have been largely overhauled to introduce a new mechanic: Armor Set Bonuses. The purpose of this change was
two-fold: first, to alleviate confusion about what bonuses you receive from wearing a single piece of armor from a set,
and, second, to make armor pieces more accessible at all stages of the game (i.e., this change reduces the price of a 
number of armor pieces because players can purchase the pieces individually). It also allows for more mix-and-match potential
without requiring the player to have to create custom armor. This merely represents a sample of potential armor sets,
but the possibilities are endless.

### Full Armor that has become individual pieces with set bonuses

- Cerberus Ajax Armor

### Andromeda Items

Some items are marked with an "Andromeda" flag. But this only means that the armors name and flavor text 
does not apply to Milky Way settings. We still encourage GMs to allow players to purchase these Andromeda armor, but,
above the table, decide on a different name and origin. Note that some armor from the Andromeda _game_ are not flagged.
This is because the armor could reasonably be available in the Milky Way. For Example, HyperGuardian armor was purchased
by the Andromeda Initiative and taken with them to the Andromeda Galaxy. But it was manufactured in the Milky Way by
Kassa Fabrication.

- Andromeda Elite Helmet
- Angaran Armor set
- Deep Space Explorer Armor set
- Heleus Armor set
- HyperGuardian Armor set
- Initiative Armor set
- Kett Armor set
- Maverick Armor set
- Pathfinder Armor set
- Remnant Armor
- Scavenger Armor

### New / Updated Body Armor

Additionally, some new body armor has been introduced as standard upgrades to stock armor. Names of these new armor
come from the list of Mass Effect 1 armor (though similarities stop there).

- Assassin Armor
- Crisis Armor
- Duelist Armor
- Freedom Armor
- Gladiator Armor
- Hoplite Armor
- Survivor Armor
- Liberator Armor

If you need the old armor pieces, you can find them in the [v0.9.2 Player's Manual](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hR63JVeS21uYYAnrV8PCCbsHV_jvKm8Y).
