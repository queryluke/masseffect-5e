Chemists can create helpful drugs such as NSAIDs but can also create powerful concoctions of mind-altering drugs and even poisons.

__Components__. A small bunsen burner, a set of glass vials and beakers, a small metal frame for holding vials over heat,
a centrifuge, and a collection of chemicals.

__History__. Your training in chemistry can help you when you try to recall facts about drug -elated events, medical breakthroughs,
 and infamous poisonings.

__Medicine__.
When you treat the victim of a disease, sickness, or poison, your knowledge grants you added insight into how to provide
the best care to your patient.

__Sleight of Hand__. You've learned to handle chemicals carefully, giving you an edge when interacting with
volatile substances.

__Immunity__. Your prolonged exposure to a variety of chemical allows you to handle and apply poisons and mind-altering drugs
without risk of exposing yourself to its effects.

__Create Drug__. As part of a long rest, you may create a single poison, drug, or medicine.
