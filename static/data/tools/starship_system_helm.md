A Starship's helm is the pilot seat. While most ships can be piloted by VI, the pilot monitors an array of sensors
and subroutines to optimize the ship's flight, make smooth landings, and avoid enemy fire. Pilots can also
override subsystems and take full control of the craft.

__Vehicle Handling__. Your ability in the pilot seat gives you additional insight when taking the Maneuver or Hard Maneuver
action during starship combat.

__Insight__. Gain additional insight when assessing the tales of others' piloting feats.

__Performance__. Gain additional insight when using Air or Space transports or Starships to make fantastic maneuvers
or awe-inspiring piloting feats.

__Practiced Maneuver__. Once per long rest, you can execute a practiced maneuver. Gain the benefits of a Hard Maneuver.
Creatures on board your ship automatically succeed their Constitution saving throws.
