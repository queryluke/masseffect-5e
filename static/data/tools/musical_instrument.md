Proficiency with a musical instrument indicates you are familiar with the techniques used to play it. You also have
knowledge of some songs commonly performed with that instrument.

__History__. Your expertise aids you in recalling lore related to your instrument.

__Performance__. Your ability to put on a good show is improved when you incorporate an instrument into your act.

__Compose a Tune__. As part of a long rest, you can compose a new tune and lyrics for your instrument.

__Distracting Performance__. While performing with your instrument, you can try to distract one humanoid you can see who
can see and hear you. Make a Charisma (Performance) check with your instrument contested by the humanoid's Wisdom (Insight)
check. If your check succeeds, you grab the humanoid's attention enough that it makes Wisdom (Perception) and
Intelligence (Investigation) checks with disadvantage until you stop performing.
