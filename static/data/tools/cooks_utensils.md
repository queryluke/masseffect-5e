__Components__. A metal pot, knives, forks, a stirring spoon, and a ladle.

__History__. Your knowledge of cooking techniques allows you to assess the social patterns involved in a culture's eating habits.

__Medicine__. When administering treatment, you can transform medicine that is bitter or sour into a pleasing concoction.

__Survival__. When foraging for food, you can make do with ingredients you scavenge that others would be unable to transform
into nourishing meals.

__Prepare Meals__. As part of a short rest, you can prepare a tasty meal that helps your companions regain their strength.
You and up to five creatures of your choice regain 1 extra hit point per Hit Die spent during a short rest, provided you have
access to your cook's utensils and low-grade provisions. If you use mid-grade provisions, gain 2 extra hit points per Hit Die
spent. And if you use high-grade provisions, gain 3 extra hit points per Hit Die spent.
