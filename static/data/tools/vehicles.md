Proficiency with a vehicle applies to one type of environment. The proficiency reflects the ability to navigate and maneuver
within the environment and is not limited to a specific vehicle. For example, a hovercraft could be a land or water vehicle.

### Vehicle Types

* __Land__: travel over solid surfaces
* __Water__: travel on or through liquids
* __Air__: travel _within_ a planet's atmosphere
* __Space__: travel in space, limited to small ships meant to travel short distances, like fighters and transports

__Engineering__. Vehicle proficiency combined with knowledge of engineering improves your ability to repair, maintain,
or assess vehicles of that type.

__Insight__. Your knowledge about vehicles of this type makes it easy to discern the veracity of others' boasts about their piloting
skills and past stunts.

__Investigation__. You gain insight into the environment's conditions and the safety of traveling within the conditions.

__Pilot's Luck__. If your vehicle crashes while you are driving it, you and your passengers take half damage from the crash.
