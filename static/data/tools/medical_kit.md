Medical Kits contain the necessary tools and supplies to triage injuries and treat diseases.

__Components__. A bio-scanner, medical foam, quick-hardening cast tape, a scalpel with 10 blades, a bone saw,
and a pouch that can carry up to 4 medi-gel.

__Insight__. When you spend 1 minute observing an organic creature, you gain additional insight on if the creature is injured or weakened.

__Investigation__. When you investigate a dead organic creature, you gain insight into what caused its death and how long ago it died.

__Medicine__. You can spend a medi-gel to gain advantage when stabilizing a creature.

__Healing Hands__. During a short rest, you can clean and bind the wounds of up to six willing beasts and humanoids.
Each creature that spends a Hit Die during this rest can forgo the roll and instead regain the maximum number of hit points the die can restore.
A creature can do so only once per rest, regardless of how many Hit Dice it spends.
