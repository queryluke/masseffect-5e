Proficiency with a gaming set applies to one type of game, such as Skyllian-5 or games of chance that use dice.

__Components__. A gaming set has all the pieces needed to play a specific game or type of game, such as a complete deck
of cards or a board and tokens.

__History__. Your mastery of a game includes knowledge of its history, as well as of important events it was connected
to or prominent historical figures involved with it.

__Insight__. Playing games with someone is a good way to gain an understanding of their personality, granting you a better
ability to discern their lies from their truths and read their mood.


__Sleight of Hand__. Sleight of Hand is a useful skill for cheating at a game, as it allows you to swap pieces, palm cards,
or alter a die roll. Alternatively, engrossing a target in a game by manipulating the components with dexterous
movements is a great distraction for a pickpocketing attempt.
