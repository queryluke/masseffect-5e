__Investigation, Perception__. When you inspect a painting or a similar work of visual art,

__Painting and Drawing__.
As part of a short or long rest, you can produce a simple work of art or a design for a suit of armor or vehicle. Although
your work might lack precision, you can capture an image or a scene, or make a quick copy of a piece of art you saw.

__Detailing__.
With 8 hours of work, you can detail a suit of armor. With 20 hours of work, you can detail a vehicle.
The detailing can provide advantages to skill checks made by the wearer of the armor or user of the vehicle, such
as a bonus to a stealth check for camouflage designs.
