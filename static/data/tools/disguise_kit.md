The perfect tool for anyone who wants to engage in trickery, a disguise kit enables its owner to adopt a false identity.

__Components__. A pouch of cosmetics, dyes, and a micro-fabricator.

__Deception__. In certain cases, a disguise can improve your ability to weave convincing lies.

__Intimidation__. The right disguise can make you look more fearsome.

__Performance__. A cunning disguise can enhance an audience's enjoyment of a performance, provided the disguise is properly
designed to evoke the desired reaction.

__Persuasion__. People tend to trust a person in uniform. If you disguise yourself as an authority figure, your efforts
to persuade others are often more effective.

__Create Disguise__. As part of a long rest, you can use 1 omni-gel to create a disguise. It takes you 1 minute to don such a disguise once you have created it.
You can carry only one such disguise on you at a time without drawing undue attention, unless you have something to keep them hidden.
