Any spell effect that had a player 'gain shield points', no only effects players wearing armor.

## v0.4.2
Some minor rule changes and clean-up based on a play test 1/13/18

### Armor
The starting armor was very over powered, so 'standard' armor has been added for level 1 characters. In addition, some
armor set prices have been increased.

### Classes
The Extra Attack feature said it required a short rest between uses. This was a 'misprint'.

#### Soldier
* Weapon Master: Strafe moved to 7th level. Attack as a bonus action, not free action.
* Weapon Master: Quick reload changed to Devastating Critical, gained at 15th level.

#### Engineer
* Max Tech Point progression increased
* Drones last one minute. Clarification about attack bonuses made. AC differs per drone
* Medic: Healing drone's healing done increases like cantrips (in-line with all other drones), but you gain additional stats at 14th level.
* Drone Jockey: New feature Improved Drones.
* Drone Jockey: Feature progression rearranged: Dual Drones @ 7th level. Improved drones @ 10th level.

#### Infiltrator:
Sneak attack doesn't need advantage if target is flanked.

### Spells
* Barrier is an Action, with bonus action as available advancement. It was too easy to use all your Barrier Ticks for an attack,
then cast it as a bonus action at the end of your turn for defense. While we like this possibility, it shouldn't be available right
off the bat.

## v0.4.1
Additional changes marked for 0.4.0 that didn't make it in.

* Krogan Warhammer was way too prowerful to use as a starting weapon. Damage & Min Str decreased. Chance to stun on available for unprotected enemies.

* Biotic Bullrush was revamped slightly, giving the aspects of the Charger feat when using Charge.

Pretty much all changes due, with thanks, to the lore mastery, creativity, and play testing of SleightxHope!

**Operative**
* Complete rework, all new skillz!

#### Sentinels
**Battlemaster**
* Renamed to Overwatch, with a focus on managing the battlefield. Quality justification from SleightxHope, "Think of 
Miranda Lawson, who is effectively a Sentinel without tech armor. She's a leader, giving orders from the front ... a 
Sentinel subclass that uses superior Heads Up Display tech to give the Sentinel a tech aura that lets them give split-second 
tactical info to their allies (Help action)."
* Using a variety of Rogue features plus new tactically oriented features.
* Battlemaster provides advanced option selection with all Tech/Biotics at the 10th level.

**General**
