Starting at {{ level }} level, you can strike with deadly speed. If you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one
additional attack as a bonus action. This attack can benefit from your Sneak Attack even if you have already used it this
turn, but you can't use your Sneak Attack against the same target more than once in a turn.
